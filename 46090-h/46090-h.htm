<h2 class="no-break">PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap"><i>In</i></span> <i>this volume, relating to a district with which the writer
is intimately acquainted, he has gathered up a few points
of local interest, and, in connection with these, he has endeavoured
to embody something of the traits of present life in South Lancashire
with descriptions of its scenery, and with such gleanings
from its local history as bore upon the subject, and, under the
circumstances, were available to him. How far he has succeeded
in writing a book which may be instructive or interesting, he is
willing to leave to the judgment of those who know the country
and the people it deals with. He is conscious that, in comparison
with the fertile peculiarities which Lancashire presents to writers
who are able to gather them up, and to use them well, this volume
is fragmentary and discursive; yet he believes that, so far as it
goes, it will not be wholly unacceptable to native readers.</i></p>

<p><i>The historical information, interspersed throughout the volume,
has been gleaned from so many sources that it would be a
matter of considerable difficulty to give a complete and detailed
acknowledgment of it. In every important case, however, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
acknowledgment has been given, with some degree of care, as fully
and clearly as possible, in the course of the work. Some of this
historical matter may prove to be ill-chosen, if not ill-used&mdash;perhaps
in some cases it might have been obtained in a better form, and
even more correctly given&mdash;but the writer has, at least, the satisfaction
of knowing that, with such light as he had, and with such
elements as were convenient to him, he has been guided, in his
selection of that kind of information, by a desire to obtain the most
correct and the most applicable matter which was available to him.</i></p>

<p><i>A book which is purely local in its character and bearing, as
this is, cannot be expected to have much interest for persons unconnected
with the district which it relates to. If there is any
hope of its being read at all, that hope is centred there. The
subjects it treats upon being local, and the language used in it
being often the vernacular of a particular part of the county, these
circumstances combine to narrow its circle of acquaintance. But,
in order to make that part of it which is given in the dialect as
intelligible as possible to all readers not intimate with that form
of native language, some care has been taken to explain such words
as are unusually ambiguous in form, or in meaning. And here it
may be noticed, that persons who know little or nothing of the
dialect of Lancashire, are apt to think of it as one in form and
sound throughout the county, and expect it to assume one unvaried
feature whenever it is represented in writing. This is a mistake,
for there often exist considerable shades of difference&mdash;even in
places not more than eight or ten miles apart&mdash;in the expression,
and in the form of words which mean the same thing; and, sometimes,
the language of a very limited locality, though bearing the
same general characteristics as the dialect of the county in general,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
is rendered still more perceptibly distinctive in features, by idioms
and proverbs peculiar to that particular spot. In this volume,
however, the writer has taken care to give the dialect, as well
as he could, in such a form as would convey to the mind of the
general reader a correct idea of the mode of pronunciation, and
the signification of the idioms, used in the immediate locality which
he happens to be writing about.</i></p>

<p><i>Lancashire has had some learned writers who have written
upon themes generally and locally interesting. But the successful
delineation of the quaint and racy features of its humble life has
fallen to the lot of very few. John Collier, our sound-hearted and
clear-headed native humourist of the last century, left behind him
some exquisite glimpses of the manner of life in his own nook of
Lancashire, at that time. The little which he wrote, although so
eccentric and peculiar in character as to be almost unintelligible to
the general reader, contains such evidence of genius, and so many
rare touches of nature, that to those who can discern the riches
hidden under its quaint vernacular garb, it wears a perennial
charm, in some degree akin to that which characterises the writings
of such men as Cervantes and De Foe. And, in our own day,
Samuel Bamford&mdash;emphatically a native man&mdash;has, with felicitous
truth, transferred to his pages some living pictures of Lancashire
life, which will probably be read with more interest even than
now, long after the writer has been gathered to his fathers. There
are others who have illustrated some of the conditions of social
existence in Lancashire, in a graphic manner, with more polish
and more learning; but, for native force and truth, John Collier
and Samuel Bamford are, probably, the foremost of all genuine
expositors of the characteristics of the Lancashire people.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>

<p><i>In conclusion, all that has hitherto been done in this way is
small in amount, compared with that which is left undone. The
past, and still more the disappearing present, of this important
district teem with significant features, which, if caught up and
truthfully represented, might, perhaps, be useful to the next
generation.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap"><i>Since</i></span> <i>the second issue of this volume, the matter it contained

of many crudities remaining in this, his first venture upon the
world of letters. And amongst the new matter which has been
added to the present edition, the reader will find, at least, one
article&mdash;"Saint Catherine's Chapel"&mdash;which has no direct connection

however, leave the book to such fate as awaits it; hoping that,
if time and health be granted to him, he may yet do something

<p class="drop-capi1"><span class="smcap">I have</span> spent many a pleasant day at the village of
Bardsea, three miles south of Ulverstone. It stands
close to Conishead Park, high upon a fertile elbow of
land, the base of which is washed on two sides by the
waters of Morecambe Bay. It is an old hamlet, of about fifty
houses, nearly all in one wandering street, which begins at the
bottom of a knoll, on the Ulverstone side, and then climbs to a
point near the summit, where three roads meet, and where the
houses on one side stand back a few yards, leaving an open
ground like a little market-place. Upon the top of the knoll, a
few yards east of this open space, the church stands, overlooking
sea and land all round. From the centre of the village the street
winds on towards the beach. At this end a row of neat houses
stands at a right angle, upon an eastward incline, facing the sea.
The tide washes up within fifty yards of these houses at high
water. At the centre of the village, too, half a dozen pleasant
cottages leave the street, and stand out, like the fin of a fish, in a
quiet lane, which leads down into a little shady glen at the foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
of Birkrigg. The same lane leads, by another route, over the top
of that wild hill, into the beautiful vale of Urswick. Bardsea is
a pretty, out of the way place, and the country about it is very
picturesque and varied. It is close to the sea, and commands a
fine view of the bay, and of its opposite shores, for nearly forty
miles. About a mile west of the village, Birkrigg rises high
above green pastures and leafy dells that lap his feet in beauty.
Northward, the road to Ulverstone leads through the finest part
of Conishead Park, which begins near the end of the village.
This park is one of the most charming pieces of undulant woodland
scenery I ever beheld. An old writer calls it "the Paradise
of Furness." On the way to Ulverstone, from Bardsea, the
Leven estuary shows itself in many a beautiful gleam through
the trees of the park; and the fells of Cartmel are in full view
beyond. It is one of the pleasantest, one of the quietest walks
in the kingdom.</p>

<p>The last time I saw Bardsea it was about the middle of July.
I had gone there to spend a day or two with a friend. There
had not been a cloud on the heavens for a week; and the smell
of new hay came on every sigh that stirred the leaves. The
village looked like an island of sleepy life, with a sea of greenery
around it, surging up to the very doors of its white houses, and
flinging the spray of nature's summer harmonies all over the place.
The songs of birds, the rustle of trees, the ripple of the brook at
the foot of the meadows, and the murmur of the sea, all seem to
float together through the nest of man, making it drowsy with
pleasure. It was fairly lapped in soothing melody. Every breath
of air brought music on its wings; and every song was laden
with sweet smells. Nature loved the little spot, for she caressed
it and croodled about it, like a mother singing lullabies to a tired
child. And Bardsea was pleased and still, as if it knew it all.
It seemed the enchanted ear of the landscape; for everywhere
else the world was alive with the jocund restlessness of the
season. My friend and I wandered about from morning to
night. In the heat of the day the white roads glared in the
sun; and, in some places, the air seemed to tremble at about a
man's height from the ground, as I have seen it tremble above a
burning kiln sometimes. But for broad day we had the velvet
glades and shady woods of Conishead to ramble in; and many
a rich old lane, and some green dells, where little brooks ran
whimpling their tiny undersongs, in liquid trebles, between banks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
of nodding wild flowers. Our evening walks were more delightful
still; for when soft twilight came, melting the distinctions
of the landscape in her dreamy loveliness, she had hardly time
to draw "a thin veil o'er the day" before sea and land began to
shine again under the radiance of the moon. Wandering among
such scenes, at such a time, was enough to touch any man's
heart with gratitude for the privilege of existence in this world
of ours.</p>

<p>My friend's house stands upon a buttressed shelf of land, half-way
up the slope which leads from the shore into Bardsea. It
is the most seaward dwelling of the place; and it is bowered
about on three sides with little plots of garden, one of them kept
as a playground for the children. It commands a glorious view
of the bay, from Hampsfell, all round by Arnside and Lancaster,
down to Fleetwood. Sometimes, at night, I have watched the
revolutions of the Fleetwood light, from the front of the house,
whilst listening to the surge of the tide along the shore, at the
foot of the hill.</p>

<p>One day, when dinner was over, we sat down to smoke at an
open window, which looked out upon the bay. It was about
the turning of the tide, for a fisherman's cart was coming slowly
over the sands, from the nets at low water. The day was unusually
hot; but, before we had smoked long, I felt as if I
couldn't rest any longer indoors.</p>

<p>"Where shall we go this afternoon?" said I, knocking the
ashes out of my pipe upon the outside sill.</p>

<p>"Well," replied my friend, "I have been thinking that we
couldn't do better than stroll into the park a while. What do
you say?"</p>

<p>"Agreed," said I. "It's a bonny piece of woodland. I
dare say many a Roman soldier has been pleased with the place,
as he marched through it, sixteen centuries ago."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," said he, smiling, and taking his stick from the
corner; "but the scene must have been very different then.
Come along."</p>

<p>At the garden gate we found three of his flaxen-headed
children romping with a short-legged Scotch terrier, called
"Trusty." The dog's wild eyes shone in little slits of dusky
fire through the rusty thicket of gray hair which overhung them.
"Trusty" was beside himself with joy when we came into the
road; and he worried our shoes, and shook our trousers' slops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
in a sham fury, as if they were imaginary rats; and he bounced
about and barked, till the quiet scene, from Bardsea to Birkrigg,
rang with his noisy glee. Some of the birds about us seemed to
stop singing for a few seconds, and, after they had taken an
admiring look sideway at the little fellow, they burst out again
louder than ever, and in more rollicking strains, heartily infected
with the frisky riot of that little four-legged marlocker. Both
the dog and the children clamoured to go with us. My friend
hesitated as first one, then another, tugged at him, and said: "Pa,
let me go." Turning to me, he scratched his head, and said:
"I've a good mind to take Willie." The lad instantly gave a
twirl round on one heel, and clapped his hands, and then laid
hold of his father's coat-lap, by way of clenching the bargain at
once. But, just then, his mother appeared at the gate, and said:
"Eh, no, Willie, you'd better not go. You'll be so tired. Come,
stay with me. That's a good boy." Willie let go his hold
slowly, and fell back with a disappointed look. "Trusty"
seemed to know that there was a hitch in the matter, for he
suddenly became quieter; and, going up to Willie, he licked his
hands consolingly, and then, sitting down beside him, he looked
round from one to another, to see how the thing was to end.</p>

<p>"Don't keep tea waiting for us," said my friend, "we'll be
back in time for an early supper."</p>

<p>"Very well," replied his good wife; "we'll have something
nice. Don't be late."</p>

<p>The dog was now whining and wrestling in the arms of Willie,
who was holding him back. We made our bows, and bade
"Good-bye" to the children and to their mother, and then turned
up the road. Before we had got many yards, she called out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, Chris, if you go as far as Ulverstone, call at Mrs.
Seatle's, and at Town and Fell's, for some things which I ordered.
Bella Rigg can bring them down in her cart. These children
want a new skipping rope, too: and you might bring something
for Willie."</p>

<p>The little girls begun to dance about, shaking their sunny locks,
and singing, "Eh, a new skipping rope! a new skipping rope!"
Then the youngest seized her father's hand, and cocking up her
rosy button-hole of a mouth, she said, "Pa! Pa! lift me up! I
want to tell you somefin."</p>

<p>"Well; what is it, pet?" said he, taking her in his arms.</p>

<p>Clipping his neck as far as she could, she said, "Div me a tis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
first." And then she whispered in his ear, "If&mdash;you'll&mdash;buy&mdash;me&mdash;a
<i>big</i> doll, I'll sing, 'Down in a low and drassy bed,' four
times, when you tum home,&mdash;<i>now</i> then. 'Trusty' eated my
odder doll, when we was playin' shop in de dardin." And then
he had to kiss them again, and promise&mdash;I know not what.</p>

<p>Once more we said "Good bye," and walked up towards the
white village; the chime of sweet voices sinking into a silvery
hum as we got farther off. Everything in Bardsea was unusually
still. Most of the doors and windows were open; and, now
and then, somebody peeped out as we passed by, and said it was
"a fine day." Turning round to look at the sands, we saw the
dumpy figure of "Owd Manuel," the fisherman, limping up
from the foot of the slope, with his coat slung upon his arm.
The old man stopped, and wiped his forehead, and gave his
crutch a flourish, by way of salutation. We waved our hats
in reply, and went on. At the centre of the village stands
the comfortable inn, kept by "Old Gilly," the quaint veteran
who, after spending the prime of manhood in hard service among
the border smugglers, has settled down to close the evening of
his life in this retired nest. Here, too, all was still, except the
measured sound of a shoemaker's hammer, ringing out from the
open door of a cottage, where "Cappel" sat at his bench, beating
time upon a leather sole to the tune of a country song. And, on
the shady side, next door to the yard wall, which partly encloses
the front of the old inn, the ruddy, snow-capped face and burly
figure of "Old Tweedler" was visible, as still as a statue. He
was in his shirt sleeves, leaning against the door-cheek of his little
grocery shop, smoking a long pipe, and looking dreamily at the
sunny road. "Tweedler" needs a good deal of wakening at any
time; but when he is once fairly wakened, he is a tolerable player
on the clarionet, and not a very bad fiddler; and he likes to talk
about his curious wanderings up and down the kingdom with
show-folk. When the old man had found us out, and had partly
succeeded in getting his heavy limbs into a mild disposition to
move, he sidled forth from his little threshold, and came towards
us, gurgling something from his throat that was not unlike the
low growl of an old hoarse dog. His gruff, slow-motioned voice
sounded clear all around, waking the echoes of the sleepy houses,
as he said, "Well,&mdash;gen-tle-men. What? Wheer are you for,&mdash;to-day?"
We told him that we were going down to the Priory,
for a stroll; but we should like to call at "Gilly's" first, for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
few minutes, if he would go in with us. "Well," said he; "it's
a very het day an' I don't mind hevin' an odd gill. In wi' ye,&mdash;an'
I'll follow&mdash;in a minute," and then he sidled back to his nest.</p>

<p>There was not a sound of life in "Old Gilly's" house; but
the trim cap of his kind dame was visible inside, bobbing to and
fro by the window of the little bar. "Gilly," in his kind-hearted
way, always calls her "Mammy." We looked in at the bar, and
the old lady gave us a cordial welcome. "My good-man has
just gone to lie down," said she; "but I'll go and tell him."
We begged that she would let him rest, and bring us three glasses
of her best ale. The sun shone in strongly at the open back door.
At the rear of the house, there is a shady verandah, and a garden
in front of it. There we sat down, looking at the bright bay.
The city of Lancaster was very distinct, on the opposite side of
the water, more than twenty miles off. In a few minutes we
heard Tweedler's cart-horse tread, as he came through the
lobby, with two books in his hand.</p>

<p>"There," said he, handing one of them to me; "I've turned
that up amang a lot o' lumber i't house. I warnd it's just the
thing for ye. What the devil is't, think ye? For it's past my skill."</p>

<p>It was an old, well-thumbed Latin Delectus, with one back
off, and several leaves gone. It was not of much use to me;
but when the old man said, "Now, that's a fine book, I'll
awarnd, an' I'll mak' ye a present on't," I felt bound to receive
it thankfully; and I did so.</p>

<p>"An' this," said he, holding up the other; "is a book o' sangs.
Cummerlan' sangs."</p>

<p>It was a thin volume, in papered boards&mdash;a cheap edition of
Anderson's ballads&mdash;printed in double column, royal octavo.</p>

<p>"Ay." replied my friend; "I should like to look at that."</p>

<p>"Varra well," said Tweedler; "put it i' your pocket. I'll
land it ye." And then, as if half-repenting, he continued, "But
I set a deal o' store o' that book. I don't think as I could get
another for ony money."</p>

<p>"You shall have it back in a day or two," said my friend.</p>

<p>"Oh," replied Tweedler, "it's all reight wi' ye. But I
wouldn't ha' lant it onybody, mind ye."</p>

<p>My friend put the book in his pocket, promising to take
especial care of it; and then we drank up, and came away; and
Tweedler sauntered back to lean against the door-cheek, and
smoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>It was about half-past one when we walked out at the landward
end of the village. The only person we met was a
horseman, riding hastily up from the skirt of the park. As he
sped by I recognised the tall figure and benevolent face of Dr.
Anderson, of Ulverstone. Near Bardsea Hall an old lane leads
off at the right-hand of the road, down to the sea-beach, from
whence there is a pleasant walk along the shore of the Leven
estuary, to a little fishing village, called Sandside, and thence a
good road, between meadow lands, up into Ulverstone. After
a minute's conversation, at the end of this lane, we agreed to go
that way. When we came out upon the shore, my friend
stopped, and looked across the sands.</p>

<p>"Was you ever on Chapel Island?" said he, pointing
towards it.</p>

<p>"No," replied I; "but I should like to see that spot. Are
there any remains of the old chantry left?"</p>

<p>"A few," said he; "mostly incorporated with the house of
a fisherman who lives on the island. But we'll go over to it.
There's nice time to get across before the tide comes in. It's
not much more than a mile."</p>

<p>I was pleased with the idea of seeing this little historic island,
of which I had read and heard so much; so we strode out
towards it at once. The sands between looked as level as a
bowling-green, and perfectly dry; and it did not seem to me
more than half the distance my friend had said. Before we had
gone many yards he began a story:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The last time I was on the island there were several friends&mdash;But
hold! we had better take something to eat and drink. They'll
have next to nothing there; and we shall have to stop till the
next ebb. Wait here. I'll run back. I shan't be many minutes."
And away he went to the green lane.</p>

<p>There was an old black boat on the sands, close to where he
had left me. I got into it, and, pulling my hat over my eyes to
shade the sun away, I lay down on my back and listened to the
birds in Conishead Park. It was something more than a quarter
of an hour before he appeared at the end of the lane again, with
a brown bottle in one hand and with pockets well stored.
Without stopping an instant, he walked right out upon the
sands, wiping the perspiration from his brow as he went.
Staring straight at the island, he said, "Come on. We've no
time to lose, now. But we can manage it." I remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
fancying that there was an unusual earnestness in the tone of his
voice; but I did not think much more about it at the time, for
the sands still seemed quite dry between us and the island; so I
followed him in silence, looking round at the beautiful scene,
with my mind at ease. My friend was a tall, lithe man, in the
prime of life, and a very good walker. I had not been well for
some days previous, and I began to feel that the rate he was
going at was rather too much for me. Besides, I had a pair of
heavy, double-soled boots on, and my thick coat was loaded with
books and papers. But I laboured on, perspiring freely. I
thought that I could manage well enough to keep up with him
for the distance we had to go. In a few minutes we began to
come to patches of wet sand, where the feet sank at every step,
and our progress was slower, though a good deal more difficult.
We did not seem to get much nearer the island, though we were
walking so hard. This tried me still more; and, not seeing any
need for such a desperate hurry, I said, "Don't go so fast!"
But he kept up the pace, and, pointing to where a white sail
was gliding up the other side of the island, towards Ulverstone,
he said, "Come along! The main channel's filling! We've a
channel to cross on this side, yet. D'ye see yon white line? It's
the tide rushing in! Come on! We can't turn back now!"
It was only then that I began to see how we were situated; and
I tramped on at his heels, through the soft wet sand, perspiring
and panting, and still without seeming to get over much ground.
In a few minutes we came to a shallow channel, about eight or
ten yards across. We splashed through, without speaking. It
only took us a little above the knee; but, I perceived that the
water was rising rapidly. Thinking that the danger was over,
I stammered out, "Stop! Slacken a bit! We're all right now!"
But the tone, as well as the words of his reply, startled me, as
he shot ahead, crying, "This is not it! This is nothing! Come
on!" I was getting exhausted; and, when he cried out,
"Double!" and broke into a run, I had not breath to spare for
an answer; but I struggled on desperately. The least false step
would have brought me down; and, if I had fallen, I think that
even that delay would have been more than we had to spare.
Three or four minutes brought us up to the channel he had
spoken of. It was an old bed of the river Leven. It must have
been from fifteen to twenty yards wide at that moment, and the
tide was increasing it at a terrible rate. When we got to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
edge of the water, I was so done up that I panted out: "Stop!
I can't go so fast!" But my friend turned half round, with a
wild look, and almost screamed: "But you must! It's death!"
Then we went into the water, without any more words. I was
a little on one side of him, and about two yards in the rear. It
is a wonder to me now how I got through that deep, strong,
tidal current. The water must have revived me a little, unconsciously
to myself, at the time. Before we had got to the
middle, I saw the book of ballads in the side pocket of my
friend's shooting coat disappearing in the water as he went
deeper into the channel. My clothes began to grow heavy, and
the powerful action of the tide swayed me about so much that
I could hardly keep my feet, and I expected every moment being
whelmed over. But somehow I strove on, the water deepening
at every step. A thousand thoughts crowded into my mind
whilst wading that channel. I remember distinctly the terrible
stillness of the scene; the frightful calm of the blue sky; the
rocky island, with its little grove of trees, waving gracefully in
the sunshine&mdash;all so beautiful, yet all looking down with such a
majestic indifference upon us, as we wrestled for life with the
rising tide. About mid-channel, when the water was high up
my breast, my friend gave a wild shout for help, and I instantly
did the same. The island was not much more than forty yards
off. As my friend turned his head, I caught a glimpse of his
haggard look, and I thought all was over. The rocks re-echoed
our cries; but everything was still as death, except the little
grove of trees waving in the sunshine. There was not a living
soul in sight. My heart sank, and I remember feeling, for an
instant, as if it was hardly worth while struggling any longer.
And here let me bear testimony to a brave act on the part of
my friend. In the deepest part of the channel, when the water
was near the top of my shoulders, he put out his stick sideway,
and said, "Get hold!" I laid only a feeble grasp upon it, for I
had enough to do to keep my feet. When we had waded about
three yards in this way, we began to see that we were ascending
the opposite bank rapidly, for it was steeper than the other one.
In two minutes more we were out upon the dry sands, with our
clothes clinging heavily about us, and our hearts beating wild
with mingled emotions. "Now," said I, panting for breath,
"let's sit down a minute." "No, no!" replied he in a resolute
tone, pushing on; "come farther off." A walk of about thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
yards brought us to the foot of the rocks. We clambered painfully
up from stone to stone, till we came upon a little footpath
which led through the grove and along the garden to the old
fisherman's cottage, on the north side of the island. As we
entered the grove I found that my friend had kept hold of the
brown bottle all the way. I did not notice this till we came to
the first patch of grassy ground, where he flung the bottle down
and walked on. He told me afterwards that he believed it had
helped to steady him whilst coming through the channel.</p>

<p>The fisherman's cottage is the only dwelling on the little island.
We found the door open, and the birds were singing merrily
among the green bushes about the entrance. There was nobody
in but the old fisherman's wife, and she was deaf. We might
have shouted long enough before she could have heard us; and
if she had heard, the poor old body could hardly have helped us.
When we got to the door, she was busy with something at the
fire, and she did not hear our approach. But, turning round,
and seeing us standing there, she gazed a few seconds with a
frightened look, and then, lifting up both hands, she cried out,
"Eh, dear o' me; good folk! Whativver's to do? Whereivver
han yo cum fra? Eh; heawivver han yo getten ower?"</p>

<p>We told our tale in a few words; and then she began again:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good lorjus days, childer! What browt yo through t'
channel at sich an ill time as this? It's a marcy 'at yo weren't
draan'd mony a time ower! It mud ha' bin my awn lads! Eh,
what trouble there'd ha' bin for someb'dy. What, ye'll ha'
mothers livin', likely; happen wives and childer?... Eh,
dear o' me! Bud cum in wi' ye! Whativver are ye stonnin'
theer for? Cum in, an' get your claes off&mdash;do! an' get into
bed this minute," said she, pointing to a little, low-roofed room
in the oldest part of the house.</p>

<p>The water from our clothes was running over the floor; but
when we spoke about it in the way of apology, the old woman
said, "Nivver ye mind't watter. Ye've had watter enough for
yance, I should think. Get in theer, I tell ye; an' tak' your weet
claes off. Now, don't stan' gabblin', but creep into bed, like
good lads; an' I'll bring ye some het tea to drink.... Eh,
but ye owt to be thankful 'at ye are wheer ye are!... Ye'd
better go into that inside room; It'll be quieter. Leave your
claes i' this nar room, an' I'll hing 'em up to dry. An' put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
some o' thoose aad shirts on. They're poor, but they're comfortable.
Now, in wi' ye! ye can talk at efter."</p>

<p>The old woman had four grown-up sons, labourers and
fishermen; and there was plenty of working clothes belonging
to them, lying about the bedroom. After we had stript our
wet things, and flung them down, one after another, with a
splash, we put on a rough shirt a-piece, and crept into bed. In
a few minutes she came in with a quart pitcher full of hot tea,
and a cup to drink it from; and, setting it down upon a chair at
the bedside, she said, "Now, get that into ye, and hev a bit of
a sleep. Eh, dear o' me! It's a marcy ye warn't draan'd!"</p>

<p>We lay still, talking and looking about us; but we could not
sleep. The excitement we had gone through had left a band of
intense pain across the lower part of my forehead, as if a hot
wire was burning into it. The walls of the room we lay in
were partly those of the ancient chapel which gives name to the
island. In fact, the little ragged, weed-grown belfrey still stood
above our heads, almost the only relic of the ruined chantry,
except the foundations, and some pieces of the old walls built up
into the cottage. This chapel was founded above five centuries
ago, by the monks of Furness. Here they prayed daily "for the
safety of the souls of such as crossed the sands with the morning
tide." The Priory of Conishead was charged with the maintenance
of guides across this estuary, which is perhaps the most
dangerous part of the Morecambe Sands. Baines says of the
route across these sands: "The tract is from Holker Hall to
Plumpton Hall, keeping Chapel Island a little to the left; and
the mind of a visitor is filled with a mixture of awe and gratitude
when, in a short time after he has traversed this estuary, almost
dry shod, he beholds the waters advancing into the bay, and
bearing stately vessels towards the harbour of Ulverstone, over
the very path which he has so recently trodden." I can imagine
how solemn the pealing of that little island chapel's bell must
have sounded upon the shores of the estuary, floating over those
dangerous waters its daily warning of the uncertainty of human
life. Perhaps the bodies of drowned men might have lain where
we were lying; or travellers rescued from the tide by those
ancient ministers of religion might have listened with grateful
hearts to the prayers and thanksgivings offered up in that venerable
chantry. The chastening interest of old pious usage clings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
to the little island still; and it stands in the midst of the waters,
preaching in mute eloquence to every thoughtful mind. There
was something in the sacred associations of the place; there was
something in the mouldering remnant of the little chapel, which
helped to deepen the interest of our eventful visit that day. We
could not sleep. The sun shone in aslant at the one tiny window
of our bedroom, and the birds were singing merrily outside. As
we lay there, thinking and talking about these things, my friend
said, "I feel thankful now that I did not bring Willie with me.
If I had done so, nothing could have saved us. The tide had
come in behind, and a minute more at the channel would have
been too much."</p>

<p>After resting about three hours, we got up, and put on some
of the cast-off clothes which had been worn by the old woman's
sons whilst working in the land. My trousers were a good deal
too long, and they were so stiff with dried slutch that they almost
stood up of themselves. When they were on, I felt as if I was
dressed in sheet-iron. I never saw two stranger figures than we
cut that day, as we entered the kitchen again, each amusing
himself with the other's comical appearance.</p>

<p>"Never ye mind," said the old woman; "there's naabody to
see ye bud mysel; ye may think varra weel 'at ye're alive to
wear owt at all. But sart'ny ye looken two bonny baygles! I
daat varra mich whether your awn folk would knaw ye. It
quite alters your fayturs. I should't tak ye to be aboon ninepence
to t' shillin' at the varra most. As for ye," said she,
addressing myself, "ye'n na 'casion to talk, for ye're as complete
a flay-crow as ivver I set e'en on,"</p>

<p>The kitchen was cleaned up, and the things emptied from
our pockets lay about. Here books and papers were opened
out to dry. There stockings hung upon a line, and our boots
were reared against the fender, with their soles turned to the
fire. On the dresser two little piles of money stood, and on a
round table were the sandwiches and hard-boiled eggs which my
friend had brought in his pockets.</p>

<p>"What are ye for wi' this?" said the old woman, pointing to
the eatables. "One or two o't eggs are crushed a bit, but t'
ham's naa warse, 'at I can see."</p>

<p>"Let us taste what it is like," said my friend.</p>

<p>"That's reight," replied she; "an' yell hev a cup o' het tea to
it. I have it ready here."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
The tea was very refreshing; but we couldn't eat much, for
we had not quite recovered from the late excitement. After a
little meal, we went out to walk upon the island. Our damp
clothes were fluttering upon the green bushes about the cottage.
They were drying fast; for, though the sun was hot, a cool
breeze swept over the bay from the south-west. We wandered
through the grove, and about the garden, or rather the "kailyard,"
for the chief things grown in it were potatoes, cabbages,
brocoli, pot-herbs, and such like things, useful at dinner time.
There were very few flowers in it, and they were chiefly such
as had to take care of themselves. In the grove there were little
bowery nooks, and meandering footpaths, mostly worn by
visitors from the neighbouring shores. The island has been
much larger than it is now. Great quantities of limestone rock
have been sold, and carried away to the mainland; and it seems
as if this little interesting leaf of local history was fated to
ultimate destruction in that way. We walked all round it, and
then we settled down upon a grassy spot, at the south-western
edge, overlooking the channel we had waded through. There
was something solemn in the thought that, instead of gazing
upon the beautiful bay, we might have been lying at that
moment in the bed of the channel there, with the sunny waters
rippling above us, or drifting out with the retiring tide to an
uncrowded grave in the western sea. The thick woods of
Conishead looked beautiful on the opposite shore, with the white
turrets of the Priory rising out of their embowering shades. A
little south of that the spire of Bardsea church pointed heavenward
from the summit of a green hill, marking the spot where
the village stood hidden from our view. White sails were
gliding to and fro upon the broad bay, like great swans with
sunlit wings. It was a beautiful scene. We sat looking at it
till we began to feel chill, and then we went back to the cottage.</p>

<p>About six o'clock the old fisherman returned home from
Ulverstone; and, soon after, two of his sons arrived from
Conishead Park, where they had been working at a deep drain.
They were tall, hardy-looking men, about middle-age. The old
fisherman, who knows the soundings of the sands all round,
seemed to think we had picked our way to the island as foolishly
as it was possible to do. He talked about the matter as if we
had as good a knowledge of the sands as himself, and had set out
with the express intention of doing a dangerous exploit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
"Now," said he, pointing a good way north of the way we
had crossed, "if ye'd ha' come o'er by theer, ye mud ha' done
it easy. Bud, what the devil, ye took the varra warst nook o't
channel. <i>I</i> wonder as ye weren't <i>draan'd</i>. I've helped to get
mony a ane aat o' that hole&mdash;baith deead an' alive. I yence
pulled a captain aat by th' yure o't' yed, as had sailed all ower
t' warld, nearly. An' we'd summat to do to bring him raand,
an' all. He was that far geean.... Now, if ye'd ha' getten
upo' yon bank," continued he, "ye mud ha' managed to ha'
studden till help had come to ye. What, ye wadn't ha' bin
varra mich aboon t' middle.... But it's getten near law
watter. I mun be off to t' nets. Will ye go daan wi' me?"</p>

<p>There were two sets of "stake nets" belonging to the island;
one on the north end, and the other on the western side, in our
own memorable channel. The sons went to those on the north;
and the old man took a stick in his hand, and a large basket on
his arm, and we followed him down the rocks to the other nets.
They are great cages of strong network, supported by lofty
poles, or stakes, from which they take their name. They are
so contrived that the fish can get into them at high water, but
cannot escape with the retiring tide. There was rather more
than a foot of water at the bottom of the nets; but there was
not a fish visible, till the old man stepped in; and then I saw
that flukes lay thick about the bottom, half-hidden in the sand.
We waded in, and helped to pick them up, till the great basket
was about half full. He then closed the net, and came away,
complaining that it was "nobbut a poor catch." When we got
to the cottage we put on our own clothes, which were quite
dry. And, after we had picked out two dozen of the finest
flukes, which the old man strung upon a stout cord for ease of
carriage, we bade adieu to the fisherman and his family, and we
walked away over the sands, nearly by the way we had come to
the island.</p>

<p>The sun had gone down behind old Birkrigg; but his westering
splendour still empurpled the rugged tops of the Cartmel hills.
The woods of Conishead were darkening into shade; and the
low of cattle came, mellowed by distance, from the rich pastures
of Furness. It was a lovely evening. Instead of going up the
green lane which leads to the landward end of Bardsea, we
turned southward, along the shore, and took a grass-grown shady
path, which winds round the sea-washed base of the hill upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
which the church stands and so up into the village by a good
road from the beach. The midges were dancing their airy
rounds; the throstle's song began to ring clearer in the stilling
woods; and the lone ouzel, in her leafy covert, chanted little fits
of complaining melody, as if she had lost something. There
were other feathered lingerers here and there in those twilight
woods, not willing yet to go to rest, through unwearied joyfulness
of heart, and still singing on, like children late at play, who
have to be called in by their mothers as night comes on. When
we drew near my friend's house, he said, "Now, we had better
not mention this little affair to our people." But, as we sat at
supper that night, I could not help feeling thankful that we
were eating fish instead of being eaten by them.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi1"><span class="smcap">One</span> fine afternoon, at the end of February, I had some
business to do in Bury, which kept me there till evening.
As twilight came on, the skies settled slowly into a
gorgeous combination of the grandest shapes and hues,
which appeared to canopy the country for miles around. The
air was clear, and it was nipping cold; and every object
within sight stood out in beautiful relief in that fine transparence,
softened by the deepening shades of evening. The
world seemed to stand still and meditate, and inhale silently the
air of peace which pervaded that tranquil hour of closing day,
as if all things on earth had caught the spirit of "meek nature's
evening comments on the fuming shows and vanities of man."
The glare of daylight is naturally fitted for bustle and business,
but such an eventide as this looked the very native hour of
devout thought, and recovery from the details of worldly occupation.
It is said that the town of Bury takes its name from
the Saxon word <i>byri</i>, a burgh, or castle. One of the twelve
ancient Saxon fortresses of Lancashire stood in the place now
called "Castle Croft," close to the town, and upon the banks of
the old course of the river Irwell. Immediately below the
eminence, upon which the castle once stood, a low tract of
ground, of considerable extent, stretches away from below the
semicircular ridge upon which the northern extremity of the
town is situated, up the valley of the Irwell. Less than fifty
years ago this tract was a great stagnant swamp, where, in
certain states of the weather the people of the neighbourhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
could see the weird antics of the "Wild Fire," or "Jack o'
Lantern," that fiend of morass and fen. An old medical gentleman,
of high repute, who has lived his whole life in the town,
lately assured me that he remembers well that, during the existence
of that poisonous swamp, there was a remarkable prevalence of
fever and ague amongst the people living in its neighbourhood;
which diseases have since then comparatively disappeared from
the locality. There is something rich in excellent suggestions in
the change which has been wrought in that spot. The valley,
so long fruitful of pestilences, is now drained and cleared, and
blooms with little garden allotments, belonging to the working
people thereabouts. Oft as I chance to pass that way, on
Saturday afternoons, or holidays, there they are, working in
their little plots, sometimes assisted by their children, or their
wives; a very pleasant scene.</p>

<p>I lingered in the market-place a little while, looking at the
parish church, with its new tower and spire, and at the fine pile
of new stone buildings, consisting of the Derby Hotel, the Town
Hall, and the Athenæum. South Lancashire has, for a very long
time past, been chiefly careful about its hard productive work,
and practicable places to do it in; and has taken little thought
about artistic ornament of any sort; but the strong old county
palatine begins to flower out a little here and there, and
this will increase as the wealth of the county becomes influenced
by elevated taste. In this new range of buildings, there
was a stateliness and beauty, which made the rest of the town of
Bury look smaller and balder than ever it seemed to me before.
It looked like a piece of the west end of London, dropped among
a cluster of weavers' cottages. But my reflections took another
direction. At "The Derby," there, thought I, will be supplied&mdash;to
anybody who can command "the one thing needful"&mdash;sumptuous
eating and drinking, fine linen, and downy beds, hung
with damask curtaining; together with grand upholstery, glittering
chandelier and looking-glass, and more than enough of other
ornamental garniture of all sorts; a fine cook's shop and dormitory,
where a man might make shift to tickle a few of his five
senses very prettily, if he was so disposed. A beggar is not
likely to put up there; but a lord might chance to go to bed
there, and dream that he was a beggar. At the other end of
these fine buildings, the new Athenæum was quietly rising into
the air. The wants to be provided for in that edifice were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
quite of another kind. There is in the town of Bury, as, more
or less, everywhere, a sprinkling of naturally active and noble
minds, struggling through the hard crust of ignorance and difficulty,
towards mental light and freedom. Such salt as this poor
world of ours has in it, is not unfrequently found among these
humble strugglers. I felt sure that such as these, at least,
would watch the laying of the stones of this new Athenæum
with a little interest. That is their grand citadel, thought I;
and from thence, the artillery of a few old books shall help to
batter tyranny and nonsense about the ears;&mdash;for there is a
reasonable prospect that there, the ample page of knowledge,
"rich with the spoils of time," will be unfolded to all who desire
to consult it; and that from thence the seeds of thought may
yet be sown over a little space of the neighbouring mental soil.
This fine old England of ours will some day find, like the rest of
the world, that it is not mere wealth and luxury, and dexterous
juggling among the legerdemain of trade, that make and maintain
its greatness, but intelligent and noble-hearted men, in whatever
station of life they grow; and they are, at least, sometimes found
among the obscure, unostentatious, and very poor. It will learn
to prize these, as the "pulse of the machine," and to cultivate
them as the chief hope of its future existence and glory; and
will carefully remove, as much as possible, all unnecessary difficulties
from the path of those who, from a wise instinct of
nature, are impelled in the pursuit of knowledge by pure love of
it, for its own sake, and not by sordid aims.</p>

<p>The New Town Hall is the central building of this fine pile.
The fresh nap was not yet worn off it; and, of course, its
authorities were anxious to preserve its pristine Corinthian beauty
from the contaminations of "the unwashed." They had made
it nice, and they wanted none but nice people in it. At the
"free exhibition" of models for the Peel monument, a notice
was posted at the entrance, warning visitors, that "Persons in
Clogs" would not be admitted. There are some Town Halls
which are public property, in the management of which a kindred
solicitude prevails about mere ornaments of wood and stone, or
painting, gilding, and plaster work; leading to such restrictions
as tend to lessen the service which they might afford to the
whole public. They are kept rather too exclusively for grandee-festivals;
and gatherings of those classes which are too much
sundered from the poor by a Chinese wall of exclusive feeling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
I have known the authorities of such places make "serious
objections to evening meetings;" and yet, I have often seen the
farce of "public meetings" got up ostensibly for the discussion
of some important question then agitating the population of the
neighbourhood, inviting <i>public</i> discussion, at <i>eleven</i> o'clock in
the <i>forenoon</i>, an hour when the heterodox multitude would be
secure enough at their labour; and, in this way, many a pack
of fanatic hounds&mdash;and there are some such in all parties&mdash;have
howled out their hour with a clear stage and no foe; and then
walked off glorying in a sham triumph, leaving nothing
beaten behind them but the air they have tainted with <i>ex parte</i>
denunciation. And, in my erroneous belief that this Town
Hall, into which "Persons in Clogs" were not to be admitted, was
public property, the qualification test seemed to be of a queer
kind, and altogether at the wrong end of the man. Alas, for
these poor lads who wear clogs and work-soiled fustian garments;
it takes a moral Columbus, every now and then, to keep the
world awake to a belief that there is something fine in them,
which has been running to waste for want of recognition
and culture. Blessed and beautiful are the feet, which fortune
has encased in the neat "Clarence," of the softest calf or
Cordovan, or the glossy "Wellington," of fine French leather.
Even so; the woodenest human head has a better chance in this
world if it come before us covered with a good-looking hat.
But woe unto your impertinent curiosity, ye unfortunate clog-wearing
lovers of the fine arts!&mdash;(I was strongly assured that
there were several curious specimens of this strange animal extant
among the working people of Bury.) It was pleasant to hear,
however, that several of these ardent persons, of questionable
understanding, meeting with this warning as they attempted to
enter the hall, after duly contemplating it with humourous awe,
doffed their condemned clogs at once, and, tucking the odious
timber under their arms, ran up the steps in their stocking-feet.
It is a consolation to believe that these clogs of theirs are not the
only clogs yet to be taken off in this world of ours. But, as this
"Town Hall" is private property, and, as it has been settled
by somebody in the north that "a man can do what he likes
with his own," these reflections are, perhaps, more pertinent to
other public halls that I know of than to this one.</p>

<p>In one of the windows of "The Derby" was exhibited a
representation of "The Eagle and Child," or, as the country-folk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
in Lancashire sometimes call it, "Th' Brid and Bantlin',"
the ancient recognizance of the Stanleys, Earls of Derby, and
formerly kings of the Isle of Man, with their motto, "Sans
changer," in a scroll beneath. This family still owns the manor
of Bury, and has considerable possessions there. They have
also large estates and great influence in the north and west of
Lancashire. In former times they have been accounted the most
powerful family of the county; and in some of the old wars,
they led to the field all the martial chivalry of Lancashire and
Cheshire under their banner. As I looked on the Stanley's crest,
I thought of the fortunes of that noble house, and of the strange
events which it had shared with the rest of the kingdom. Of
James, Earl of Derby, who was beheaded at Bolton-le-Moors, in
front of the Man and Scythe Inn, in Deansgate, two centuries
since; and of his countess, Charlotte de Tremouille, who so
bravely defended Lathom House against the parliamentary forces
during the last civil wars. She was daughter to Claude, Duke
of Tremouille, and Charlotte Brabantin de Nassau, daughter of
William, Prince of Orange, and Charlotte de Bourbon, of the
royal house of France. Apart from the pride of famous
descent, both the earl and his lady were remarkable for certain
noble qualities of mind, which commanded the respect of
all parties in those troubled times. I sometimes think that if
it had pleased Heaven for me to have lived in those days, I
should have been compelled by nature to fall into some Roundhead
rank, and do the best I could, for that cause. When a lad
at school I had this feeling: and, as I poured over the history of
that period, I well remember how, in my own mind, I shouted
the solemn battle-cry with great Cromwell and his captains,
and charged with the earnest Puritans, in their bloody struggles
against the rampant tyrannies of the time. Yet, even then, I
never read of this James, Earl of Derby&mdash;the faithful soldier of
an infatuated king&mdash;without a feeling of admiration for the
chivalry of his character. I lately saw, in Bolton, an antique
cup of "stone china," quaintly painted and gilt, out of which it
is said that he drank the communion immediately before his
execution. Greenhalgh, of Brandlesome, who was a notable
and worthy man, and who governed the Isle of Man for the
Earls of Derby, lived at Brandlesome Hall, near Bury. Respecting
Edward, the third earl, Camden says: "With Edward,
Earl of Derby's death, the glory of hospitality seemed to fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
asleep." Of his munificent housekeeping, too, he tells us:
how he fed sixty old people twice a day, every day, and all
comers twice a week; and every Christmas-day, for thirty-two
years, supplied two thousand seven hundred with meat, drink,
money, and money's worth; and how he offered to raise ten
thousand soldiers for the king. Also, that he had great reputation
as a bone-setter, and was a learned man, a poet, and a man
of considerable talent in many directions. The present Lord
Stanley<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> is accounted a man of great ability as a politician and
orator, and of high and impetuous spirit; and is the leader of the
Conservative party in parliament. A century ago, the influence
of great feudal families, like the Stanleys, was all but supreme in
Lancashire; but, since that time, the old landlord domination
has declined in the manufacturing districts; and the people have
begun to set more value upon their independent rights as men,
than upon the painful patronage of feudal landlords.</p>

<p>I had no time to devote to any other of the notabilities of
Bury town; and I thought that "Chamber Hall," the birthplace
of the great departed statesman, Peel, would be worth a
special pilgrimage some Saturday afternoon.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> I had finished my
business about seven o'clock, and, as the nightfall was fine and
clear, I resolved to walk over to Rochdale, about six miles off,
to see an old friend of mine there. Few people like a country
walk better than I do; and being in fair health and spirits,
I took the road at once, with my stick in hand, as brisk as a
Shetland pony, in good fettle. Striking out at the town-end, I
bethought me of an old herbalist, or "yarb doctor," who lived
somewhere thereabouts&mdash;a genuine dealer in simples, bred up in
the hills, on Ashworth Moor, about three miles from the town,
and who had made the botany of his native neighbourhood a
life-long study. Culpepper's "Herbal" was a favourite book
with him, as it is among a great number of the country people
of Lancashire, where there are, perhaps, more clever botanists
in humble life to be found than in any other part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
kingdom. Nature and he were familiar friends, for he was a
lonely rambler by hill, and clough, and field, at all seasons of the
year, and could talk by the hour about the beauties and medicinal
virtues of gentian, dandelion, and camomile, or tansy, mountain
flax, sanctuary, hyssop, buckbean, wood-betony, and "Robin-run-i'-th'-hedge,"
and an endless catalogue of other herbs and
plants, a plentiful assortment of which he kept by him, either
green or in dried bundles, ready for his customers. The
country people in Lancashire have great faith in simples, and
in simple treatment for their diseases. I well remember that
one of their recipes for a common cold is "a wot churn-milk
posset, weel sweet'nt, an' a traycle cake to't, at bed-time."
They are profound believers in the kindly doctrine expressed in
that verse of George Herbert's:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"More servants wait on man</span><br />
<span class="i0">Than he'll take notice of; in ev'ry path</span><br />
<span class="i2">He treads down what befriends him</span><br />
<span class="i2">Then sickness makes him pale and wan.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Oh, mighty love! man is one world, and hath</span><br />
<span class="i2">Another to attend him."</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>Therefore, our primitive old herb-doctor had in his time driven
what he doubtless considered, in his humble way, a pretty gainful
trade. And he was not exactly "a doctor-by-guess," as the Scotch
say, but a man of good natural parts, and of some insight into
human physiology, of great experience and observation in his
little sphere, and remarkable for strong common sense and
integrity. He was also well acquainted with the habits and the
peculiar tone of physical constitution among the people of his
neighbourhood. Like his pharmacopæia, his life and manners
were simple, and his rude patients had great confidence in
him. It was getting dark, and I did not know exactly where to
find him, or I should have liked very well to see the old botanist,
of whom I had heard a very interesting account in my native
town.</p>

<p>When one gets fairly into the country it is fine walking by a
clear starlight, when the air is touched with frost, and the ground
hard under the foot. I enjoyed all this still more on that old
road, which is always rising some knoll, or descending into
some quiet clough, where all is so still that one can hear the
waters sing among the fields and stunted woods off the wayside.
The wind was blowing fresh and keen across Knowl Hill and
the heathery wastes of Ashworth and Rooley, those wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
heights which divide the vale of the Roach from the Forest of
Rossendale. I stood and looked upon the blue heavens, "fretted
with golden fire," and around me upon this impressive night-scene,
so finely still and solemn, the effect deepened by the
moanings of the wind among the trees. My mind reverted to
the crowded city, and I thought to myself&mdash;this is rather different
to Market-street, in Manchester, on a Tuesday forenoon, about
the time of "high change," as I listened to the clear "Wo-up!"
of a solitary carter to his horse on the top of the opposite knoll,
and heard the latch of a cottage-door lifted, and saw the light
from the inside glint forth into the trees below for an instant.
It was a homely glimpse, which contrasted beautifully with the
sombre grandeur of the night. The cottage-door closed again,
the fireside picture was gone; and I was alone on the silent road,
with the clear stars looking down.</p>

<p>I generally put off my meals till I get a hint from the inside;
and, by the time that I reached the bottom of a lonely dell, about
three miles on the road, I began to feel hungry, and I stepped
into the only house thereabouts, a little roadside inn, to get a
bite of something. The house stands near to a narrow woody
ravine which runs under the highway at that place. It is said
to have been entirely built by one man, who got the stone,
hewed it, cut the timber, and shaped it, and altogether built the
house, such as it is; and it has an air of primitive rudeness about
it, which partly corroborates the story. The very hearth-flag
is an old gravestone, brought from the yard of some ancient
moorland chapel; and part of the worn lettering is visible upon
it still. It is known to the scattered inhabitants of that district
by the name of "The house that Jack built." On entering the
place, I found the front room dark and quiet, and nothing stirring
but in the kitchen, where I saw the light of a candle, and heard
a little music among the pots, which somebody was washing.
The place did not seem promising, so far as I could see at all,
but I felt curious, and, walking forward, I found a very homely-looking
old woman bustling about there, with a clean cap on, not
crimped nor frilled any way, but just plainly adorned with a
broad border of those large, stiff, old-fashioned puffs, which I
used to watch my mother make on the end of the "Italian iron,"
when I was a lad at home. Old Sam, the landlord, had just come
home from his work, and sat quietly smoking on the long settle,
in a nook by the fireside, while his wife, Mary, got some tea ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
for her tired old man. The entrance of a customer seemed to be
an important affair to them, and partly so, I believe, because
they were glad to have a little company in their quiet corner,
and liked to hear, now and then, how the world was wagging a
few miles off. I called for a glass of ale, and something like the
following conversation ensued:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Aw'll bring it, measter. See yo, tay this cheer. It's
as chep sittin' as stonnin'. An' poo up to th' fire, for it's noan
so warm to-neet.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Naw, it's nobbut cowdish, for sure; draw up to th' hob,
an' warm yo, for yo look'n parish't.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>"If you can bring me a crust of bread and cheese, or a bit of
cold meat, or anything, I shall be obliged to you," said I.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Ah, sure aw will. We'n a bit o' nice cowd beef;
an' I'll bring it eawt. But it's bhoylt (boiled), mind yo! Dun
yo like it bhoylt? Yo'n find it middlin' toothsome.</p>

<p>I told her that it would do very well; and then the landlord
struck in:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Doesto yer, lass. There's a bit o' pickle theer, i'th
cubbort; aw dar say he'd like some. Fot it eawt, an' let him
<i>feel</i> at it.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Oh, ay, sure there is; an' aw'll bring it, too. Aw
declare aw'd forgetten it! Dun yo like pickle, measther?</p>

<p>"I do," said I, "just for a taste."</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Well, well; aw meeon for a taste. But aw'll bring
it an' yo can help yorsel to't. Let's see, wi'n yo have hard
brade? Which side dun yo come fro?</p>

<p>"I come from Manchester," said I.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Fro Manchester, eh! Whau, then, yo'd'n rather ha'
loaf-brade, aw'll uphowd yo.</p>

<p>"Nay, nay," said I, "I'm country-bred; and I would rather
have a bit of oat-cake. I very seldom get any in Manchester;
and, when I do, it tastes as if it was mismanaged, somehow; so
a bit of good country bread will be a treat to me."</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> That's reet; aw'll find yo some gradely good stuff!
An' it's a deeol howsomer nor loaf, too, mind yo....
Neaw, wi'n nought uncuth to set afore yo; but yo'n find that
beef's noan sich bad takkin', if yor ony ways sharp set....
Theer, see yo! Nea, may yoursel' awhom, an' spare nought, for

Aw'll get vo a fork in a crack.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<p>I fell to with a hearty good-will, for the viands before me
were not scanty, and they were both wholesome, and particularly
welcome, after my sharp walk in the keen wind, which
came whistling over the moors that night. The first heat of
the attack was beginning to slacken a bit, and Old Sam, who
had been sitting in the corner, patient and pleased, all the
while, with an observant look, began to think that now there
might be room for him to put in a word or two. I, also,
began to feel as if I had no objection to taper off my meal with
a little country talk; and the old man was just asking me what
the town's folk said about the parliamentary crisis, and the
rumour which had reached him, that there was an intention of
restoring the corn-laws again, when Mary interrupted him by
saying, "Husht, Sam; doesta yer nought?" He took the pipe
out of his mouth, and, quietly blowing the smoke from the
corner of his lips, held his head on one side in a listening attitude.
Old Sam smiled, and lighting his pipe again, he said, "Ah, yon's
Jone o' Jeffry's." "It's nought else, aw believe," said Mary;
"does ta think he'll co'?" "Co', ah," replied Sam; "does he
eves miss, thinks ta? Tay thy cheer to th' tone side a bit, an'
may reawm for him, for he'll be i'th heawse in a minute." And
then, turning to me, he said, "Nea, then, measter, yo'n yer some
gam, if yor spare't." He had scarcely done speaking, when a
loud "Woigh!" was heard outside, as a cart stopped at the door,
and a heavy footstep came stamping up the lobby. The kitchen
door opened, and a full-blown Lancashire Cossack stood before
us. Large-limbed and broad-shouldered, with a great, frank,
good-tempered face, full of rude health and glee. He looked a
fine sample of simple manhood, with a disposition that seemed to
me, from the expression of his countenance, to be something
between that of an angel and a bull-dog. Giving his hands a
hearty smack, he rubbed them together, and smiled at the fire;
and then, doffing his rough hat, and flinging it with his whip
upon the table, he shouted out, "Hello! Heaw are yo&mdash;o' on
yo! Yo'r meeterly quiet again to-neet, Mary! An' some ov
a cowd neet it is. My nose sweats." The landlord whispered
to me, "Aw towd yo, didn't aw. Sit yo still; he's rare company,
is Jone."</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Ah, we're quiet enough; but we shannut be so long,
neaw at thir't come'd, Jone.</p>

<p><i>Jone.</i> Well, well. Yor noan beawn to flyte mo, owd crayter,
are yo?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Tay no notiz on hur, wilto, foo; hoo meeons nought
wrang.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Nut aw! Sit to deawn, Jone. We'er olez fain to
sitho; for thir't noan one o'th warst mak o' folk, as roof as to art.</p>

<p><i>Jone.</i> Aw'st sit mo deawn, as what aw am; an' aw'st warm
me too, beside; an' aw'll ha' summat to sup too, afore aw darken
yon dur-hole again.... Owd woman, fill mo one o'th
big'st pots yo han, an' let's be havin' houd, aw pray yo; for
my throttle's as dry as a kex. An' be as slippy as ever yo con,
or aw'st be helpin' mysel, for it's ill bidein' for dry folk amung
good drink!</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Nay, nay; aw'll sarve tho, Jone, i' tho'll be patient
hauve a minute; an' theaw'st ha' plenty to start wi', as
heaw't be.</p>

<p><i>Jone.</i> "That's just reet," said Pinder, when his wife bote hur
tung i' two! Owd woman, yo desarv'n a comfortable sattlement
i'th top shop when yo dee'n; an' yo'st ha' one, too, iv
aw've ony say i'th matter.... Eh, heaw quiet yo are, Sam!
By th' mass, iv aw're here a bit moor, aw'd may some rickin'
i' this cauve-cote, too. Whau, mon, yo'dd'n sink into a deeod
sleep, an' fair dee i'th shell, iv one didn't wakken yo up a bit,
neaw and then.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Eh, mon! Thea sees, our Sam an' me's gettin owd,
an' wi'dd'n raythur be quiet, for th' bit o' time at wi' ha'n
to do on. Beside, aw could never do wi' roof wark. Raylee
o' me! It'd weary a grooin' tree to ha' th' din, an' th'
lumber, an' th' muck at te han i' some ale heawses. To my
thinkin', aw'd go as fur as othur grace<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> grew or wayter ran,
afore aw'd live amoon sich doin's. One could elthur manage
we't at th' for-end o' their days. But what, we hannot so lung
to do on neaw; an' aw would e'en like to finish as quietly as aw
can. We hannot had a battle i' this heawse as&mdash;let's see&mdash;as
three year an' moor; ha'n wi, Sam?</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Naw, aw dunnot think we han. But we soud'n a deeol
moor ale, just afore that time, too.</p>

<p><i>Jone.</i> Three year, sen yo! Eh, the dule, Mary; heaw ha'n
yo shap'd that! Whau owd Neddy at th' Hoo'senam&mdash;yo
known owd Neddy, aw reckon, dunnot yo, Sam?</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Do I know Rachda' Church steps, thinksto?</p>

<p><i>Jone.</i> Aw dar say yo known th' steps a deeol better nor yo
known th' church, owd brid!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Sam.</i> Whau, aw have been bin up thoose steps a time or two
i' my life; an thea knows, ony body at's bin up 'em a twothore<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
times, 'll nut forget 'em so soon; for if thi'n tay 'em sharpish
fro' th' botham to th' top, it'll try their wynt up rarely afore they
getten to Tim Bobbin gravestone i'th owd church-yort. But,
aw've bin to sarvice theer as oft as theaw has, aw think.</p>

<p><i>Jone.</i> Ah!&mdash;an' yo'n getten abeawt as mich good wi't, as aw
have, aw dar say; an' that's nought to crack on;&mdash;but wi'n
say no moor upo' that footin'. Iv yo known ony body at
o', yo known owd Neddy at th' Hoo'senam; and aw'll be bund
for't, 'at i' three years time he's brunt mony a peawnd o' candles
wi' watchin' folk feight i' their heawse. Eh, aw've si'n him
ston o'er 'em, wi' a candle i' eyther hont, co'in eawt, "Nea lads.
Turn him o'er Tum! Let 'em ha' reawm, chaps; let 'em
ha' reawm! Nea lads! Keep a lose leg, Jam! Nea lads!"
And then, when one on 'em wur done to th' lung-length, he'd
sheawt eawt, "Houd! he's put his hont up! Come, give
o'er, and ger up." And, afore they'd'n getten gradely wynded,
and put their clooas on, he'd offer "another quart for the next
battle." Eh, he's one o'th quarest chaps i' this nation, is owd
Ned, to my thinkin'; an' he's some gradely good points in
him, too.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> There isn't a quarer o' this countryside, as hea't be; an'
there's some crumpers amoon th' lot.</p>

<p><i>Jone.</i> Aw guess yo known Bodle, too, dunnot yo, owd Sam?</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Yigh, aw do. He wortches up at th' col-pit yon,
doesn't he?</p>

<p><i>Jone.</i> He does, owd craytur.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Let's see, isn't that him 'at skens a bit?</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> A bit, saysto, lass? It's aboon a bit, by Guy. He
skens ill enough to crack a looking-glass, welly (well-nigh).</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Eh, do let th' lad alone, folk, win yo. Aw marvel
at yo'n no moor wit nor mayin foos o' folk at's wrang wheer
they connut help it. Yo met happen be strucken yorsels!
Beside, he's somebory's chylt, an' somebory likes him too, aw'll
uphowd him; for there never wur a feaw face i' this world, but
there wur a feaw fancy to match it, somewheer.</p>

<p><i>Jone.</i> They may fancy him 'at likes, for me; but there's noan
so mony folk at'll fancy Bodle, at after they'n smelled at him
once't. An', by Guy, he's hardly wit enough to keep fro'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
runnin' again woles i'th dayleet. But, aw see yo known him
weel enough; an' so aw'll tell yo a bit of a crack abeawt him an'
Owd Neddy.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Well let's ha't; an' mind to tells no lies abeawt th' lad
i' thy talk.</p>

<p><i>Jone.</i> Bith mon, Mary, aw connut do, beawt aw say at he's
other a pratty un or a good un.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Get forrud wi' thy tale, Jone, wilto: an' bother no
moor abeawt it.</p>

<p><i>Jone</i> (Whispers to Owd Sam): Aw say. Who's that chap
at sits hutchin i' the nook theer, wi' his meawth oppen?</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Aw know not. But he's a nice quiet lad o' somebory's,
so tay no notice. Thae'll just meet plez him i' tho'll get forrud;
thae may see that, i' tho'll look at him; for he stares like a ferret
at's sin a ratton.</p>

<p><i>Jone.</i> Well, yo see'n, Sam, one mornin', after Owd Neddy
an' Bodle had been fuddlin' o' th' o'erneet, thi'dd'n just getten a
yure o' th' owd dog into 'em, an' they sit afore th' fire i' Owd
Neddy's kitchen, as quiet, to look at, as two pot dolls; but they
didn't feel so, nother; for thi'dd'n some of a yed-waache apiece,
i' th' treawth wur known. When thi'dd'n turn't things o'er a
bit, Bodle begun o' lookin' very yearn'stfully at th' fire-hole
o' at once't, and he said, "By th' mass, Ned, aw've a good
mind to go reet up th' chimbley." Well, yo known, Neddy
likes a spree as well as ony mon livin', an' he doesn't care so
mich what mak' o' one it is, nother; so as soon as he yerd that
he jumped up, an' said, "Damn it, Bodle, go up&mdash;up wi' tho!"
Bodle stood still a minute, looking at th' chimbley, an' as he
double't his laps up, he said, "Well, neaw; should aw rayley goo
up, thinksta, owd crayter?" "Go?&mdash;ah; what elze?" said
Owd Ned&mdash;"Up wi' tho; soot's good for th' bally-waach, mon;
an' aw'll gi' tho a quart ov ale when tho comes deawn again!"
"Will ta, for sure?" said Bodle, prickin' his ears. "Am aw
lyin' thinks ta?" onswer'd Owd Neddy. "Whau, then, aw'm
off, by th' mon, iv it's as lung as a steeple;" an' he made no moor
bawks at th' job, but set th' tone foot onto th' top-bar, an' up
he went into th' smudge-hole. Just as he wur crommin' hissel'
in at th' botham o'th chimbley, th' owd woman coom in to see
what they hadd'n agate; an' as soon as Bodle yerd hur, he code
eawt, "Howd her back a bit, whol aw get eawt o'th seet, or
else hoo'll poo me deawn again." Hoo stare't a bit afore hoo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
could may it eawt what it wur at're creepin up th' chimney-hole,
an' hoo said, "What mak o' lumber ha'n yo afoot neaw? for
yo're a rook o'th big'st nowmuns at ever trode ov a floor! Yo'n
some make o' divulment agate i'th chimbley, aw declare." As
soon as hoo fund what it wur, hoo sheawted, "Eh, thea greight
gawmless foo! Wheer arto for up theer! Thea'll be smoor't,
mon!" An, hoo would ha' darted forrud, an' getten howd on
him; but Owd Ned kept stonnin afore hur, an' sayin, "Let
him alone, mon; it's nobbut a bit of a spree." Then he looked
o'er his shoulder at Bodle, an' said, "Get tee forrud, wilto,
nowmun; thae met a bin deawn again by neaw;" an, as soon
as he see'd at Bodle wur gettin meeterly weel up th' hole, he
leet her go; but hoo wur to lat to get howd. An' o' at hoo
could do, wur to fot him a seawse or two o' th' legs wi' th' poker.
But he wur for up, an' nought else. He did just stop abeawt
hauve a minute&mdash;when he feld hur hit his legs&mdash;to co' eawt,
"Hoo's that at's hittin' mo?" "Whau," said hoo, "It's me,
thae greight leather-yed;&mdash;an' come deawn wi' tho! Whatever
arto' doin' i'th chimbley?" "Aw'm goin' up for ale." "Ale!
There's no ale up theer, thae greight brawsen foo! Eh,
aw wish yor Mally wur here!" "Aw wish hoo wur here,
istid o' me," said Bodle. "Come deawn witho this minute,
thae greight drunken hal!" "Not yet," said Bodle&mdash;"but
aw'll not be lung, nothur, yo may depend;&mdash;for it's noan a nice
place&mdash;this isn't. Eh! there is some ov a smudge! An' it
gwos wur as aw go fur;&mdash;a&mdash;tscho&mdash;o! By Guy, aw con see
noan&mdash;nor talk, nothur;&mdash;so ger off, an' let mo get it o'er afore
aw'm chauk't;" and then th' owd lad crope forrud, as hard as
he could, for he're thinkin' abeawt th' quart ov ale. Well, Owd
Neddy nearly skrike't wi' laughin', as he watched Bodle draw
his legs up eawt o' th' seet; an' he set agate o' hommerin' th'
chimbley whole wi' his hont, an sheawtin' up, "Go on,
Bodle, owd lad! Go on, owd mon! Thir't a reet un!
Thea'st have a quart o' th' best ale i' this hole, i' tho lives till
tho comes deawn again, as hea 'tis, owd brid! An i' tho dees
through it, aw'll be fourpence or fi'pence toawrd thi berrin."
And then he went sheawting up an' deawn, "Hey! Dun yo
yer, lads; come here! Owd Bodle's gone up th' chimbley!
Aw never sprad my e'en upo th' marrow trick to this i'
my life." Well, yo may think, Sam, th' whole heawse wur
up i' no time; an' some rare spwort they ha'dd'n; an' Owd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Neddy kept goin' to th' eawtside, to see if Bodle had getten
his yed eawt at th' top; an' then runnin' in again, an'
bawlin' up th' flue, "Bodle, owd lad, heaw arto gettin' on?
Go throo wi't, owd cock!" But, whol he're starin' and
sheawtin' up th' chimbley, Bodle lost his houd, somewheer
toawrd th' top, an' he coom shutterin' deawn again, an' o' th'
soot i' th' chimbley wi' him; an' he let wi' his hinder-end
thump o'th top-bar, an' then roll't deawn upo th' har'stone.
An' a greadly blash-boggart he looked; yo may think. Th' owd
lad seem't as if he hardly knowed wheer he wur; so he lee
theer a bit, amoon a cloud o' soot, an' Owd Neddy stoode o'er
him, laughin', an' wipein' his e'en, an' co'in eawt, "Tay thy
wynt a bit, Bodle; thir't safe londed, iv it be hard leetin'!
Thir't a reet un; bi' th' mon arto, too. Tay thy wynt, owd
bird! Thea'st have a quart, as hea 'tis, owd mon; as soon
as ever aw con see my gate to th' bar eawt o' this smudge at
thea's brought wi' tho! Aw never had my chimbley swept as
chep i' my life!"</p>

<p><i>Mary</i>. Well, if ever! Whau, it're enough to may th'
fellow's throttle up! A greight, drunken leather-yed! But,
he'd be some dry, mind yo!</p>

<p><i>Jone.</i> Yo'r reet, Mary! Aw think mysel' at a quart ov ale
'ud come noan amiss after a do o' that mak. An' Bodle
wouldn't wynd aboon once wi' it, afore he see'd th' bottom
o' th' pot, noather.</p>

<p>Well, I had a good laugh at Jone's tale, and I enjoyed his
manner of telling it, quite as much as anything there was in the
story itself; for, he seemed to talk with every limb of his body,
and every feature of his face; and told it, altogether, in such a
living way, with so much humour and earnestness, that it was
irresistible; and as I was "giving mouth" a little, with my
face turned up toward the ceiling, he turned to me, and said
quickly, "Come, aw say; are yo noan fleyed o' throwing yo'r
choles off th' hinges?". We soon settled down into a quieter
mood, and drew round the fire, for the night was cold; when
Jone suddenly pointed out to the landlord, one of those little
deposits of smoke which sometimes wave about on the bars of
the fire-grate, and, after whispering to him, "See yo, Sam; a
stranger upo th' bar, theer;" he turned to me, and said,
"That's yo, measther!" This is a little superstition, which is
common to the fire-sides of the poor in all England, I believe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
Soon after this, Mary said to Jone, "Hasto gan thy horse
aught, Jone?" "Sure, aw have," replied he, "Aw laft it
heytin', an plenty to go on wi', so then. Mon, aw reckon to
look after deawn-crayters a bit, iv there be aught stirrin'."
"Well," said she, "aw dar say thea does, Jone; an' mind
yo, thoose at winnut do some bit like to things at connut
talk for theirsels, they'n never ha' no luck, as hoo they are."
"Well," said Jone, "my horse wortches weel, an' he sleeps weel,
an' he heyts weel, an' he drinks weel, an' he parts wi't fearful
weel; so he doesn't ail mich yet." "Well," replied Mary,
"there isn't a wick thing i' this world can wortch as it should
do, if it doesn't heyt as it should do." Here I happened to take
a note-book out of my pocket, and write in it with my pencil,
when the conversation opened again.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> (Whispering.) Sitho, Jone, he's bookin' tho!</p>

<p><i>Jone.</i> Houd, measther, houd! What mak' o' marlocks are yo
after, neaw! What're yo for wi' us, theer! But aw caren't a
flirt abeawt it; for thi' connot hang folk for talkin' neaw, as
thi' could'n once on a day; so get forrud wi't, as what it is.</p>

<p>He then, also, began to inquire about the subject which was
the prevailing topic of conversation at that time, namely, the
parliamentary crisis, in which Lord John Russell had resigned
his office at the head of the government; and the great likelihood
there seemed to be of a protectionist party obtaining power.</p>

<p><i>Jone.</i> Han yo yerd aught abeawt Lord Stanley puttin' th'
Corn Laws on again? There wur some rickin' abeawt it i'
Bury teawn, when aw coom off wi' th' cart to-neet.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> They'n never do't, mon! They connot do! An' it's
very weel, for aw dunnut know what mut become o' poor folk
iv they did'n do. What think'n yo, measther?</p>

<p>I explained to them the unsettled state of parliamentary affairs,
as it had reached us through the paper; and gave them my firm
belief that the Corn Laws had been abolished once for all in this
country; and that there was no political party in England who
wished to restore them, who would ever have the power to do so.</p>

<p><i>Jone.</i> Dun yo think so? Aw'm proud to yer it!</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> An' so am aw too, Jone. But what, aw know'd it weel
enough. Eh, mon; there's a deal moor crusts o' brade lyin'
abeawt i' odd nooks an' corners, nor there wur once't ov a day.
Aw've sin th' time when thi'd'n ha' bin cleeked up like lumps
o' gowd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jone.</i> Aw think they'n ha' to fot Lord John back, to wheyve
(weave) his cut deawn yet. To my thinkin' he'd no business to lev
his looms. But aw dar say he knows his own job betther nor
me. He'll be as fause as a boggart, or elze he'd never ha' bin
i' that shop as lung as he has bin; not he. There's moor in his
yed nor a smo'-tooth comb con fot eawt. What thinken yo,
owd brid?</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> It's so like; it's so like! But aw dunnot care who's in,
Jone, i' thi'n nobbut do some good for poor folk; an' that's one
o' th' main jobs for thoose at's power to do't. But, iv they
wur'n to put th' Corn Bill on again, there's mony a theawsan'
would be clemmed to deeoth, o' ov a rook.</p>

<p><i>Jone.</i> Ah, there would so, Sam, 'at I know on. But see yo;
there's a deal on 'em 'ud go deawn afore me. Aw'd may
somebody houd back whol their cale coom! Iv they winnot gi'
me my share for wortchin' for, aw'll have it eawt o' some nook,
ov aw dunnot, damn Jone! (striking the table heavily with his
fist.) They's never be clemmed at ir heawse, as aw ha' si'n folk
clemmed i' my time&mdash;never, whol aw've a fist a th' end o' my
arm! Neaw, what have aw towd yo!</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Thea'rt reet lad! Aw houd te wit good, by th' mass!
Whol they gi'n us some bit like ov a choance, we can elther do.
At th' most o' times, we'n to kill 'ursels (ourselves) to keep 'ursels,
welly; but, when it comes to scarce wark an' dear mheyt, th'
upstroke's noan so fur off.</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Ay, ay. If it're nobbut a body's sel', we met manage
to pinch a bit, neaw an' then; becose one could reayson abeawt
it some bit like. But it's th' childer, mon, it's th' childer!
Th' little things at look'n for it reggelar; an' wonder'n heaw it
is when it doesn't come. Eh, dear o' me! To see poor folk's
little bits o' childher yammerin' for a bite o' mheyt&mdash;when
there's noan for 'em; an' lookin' up i' folk's faces, as mich as to
say, "Connut yo help mo?" It's enough to may (make) onybody
cry their shoon full!</p>

<p>Here I took out my book to make another note.</p>

<p><i>Jone.</i> Hello! yo'r agate again! What, are yo takkin th'
pickter on mo, or summat?... Eh, Sam; what a thing
this larnin' is. Aw should ha' bin worth mony a theawsan
peawnd if aw could ha' done o' that shap, see yo!</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Aw guess thea con write noan, nor read noather, con
ta, Jone?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jone.</i> Not aw! Aw've no moor use for a book nor a duck
has for a umbrell. Aw've had to wortch hard sin aw're five
year owd, mon. Iv aw've aught o' that mak to do, aw go to
owd Silver-yed at th' lone-side wi't. It may's mo mad, mony a
time, mon; one looks sich a foo!</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> An' he con write noan mich, aw think, con he?</p>

<p><i>Jone.</i> Naw. He went no fur nor pot-hook an' ladles i' writin',
aw believe. But he can read a bit, an' that's moor nor a deeol
o' folk abeawt here can do. Aw know nobory upo this side at's
greadly larnt up, nobbut Ash'oth parson. But there's plenty o'
chaps i' Rachdaw teawn at's so brawsen wi' wit, whol noather
me, nor thee, nor no mon elze, con may ony sense on 'em. Yo
reckelect'n a 'torney co'in' here once't. What dun yo think o' him?</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> He favvurs a foo, Jone; or aw'm a foo mysel'.</p>

<p><i>Jone.</i> He's far larnt i' aught but honesty, mon, that's heaw it
is. He'll do no reet, nor tay no wrang. So wi'n lap it up just
wheer it is; for little pigs ha'n lung ears.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Aw'll tell tho what, Jone; he's a bad trade by th' hond,
for one thing; an' a bad trade'll mar a good mon sometimes.</p>

<p><i>Jone.</i> It brings moor in nor mine does. But wi'n let it drop.
Iv aw'd his larnin, aw'd may summat on't.</p>

<p><i>Sam.</i> Ah, well; it's a fine thing is larnin', Jone! It's a very
fine thing! It tay's no reawm up, mon. An' then, th' ballies
connut fot it, thea sees. But what, poor folk are so taen up wi'
gettin' what they need'n for th' bally an' th' back, whol thi'n
noathur time nor inclination for nought but a bit ov a crack for
a leetenin'.</p>

<p><i>Jone.</i> To mich so, owd Sam! To mich so!...</p>

<p><i>Mary.</i> Thae never tells one heaw th' wife is, Jone.</p>

<p><i>Jone.</i> Whau, th' owd lass is yon; an' hoo's noather sickly,
nor soory, nor sore, 'at aw know on.... Yigh, hoo's
trouble't wi' a bit ov a breykin'-eawt abeawt th' meawth,

<p>The night was wearing late, and, as I had yet nearly three
miles to go, I rose, and went my way. This road was
never so much travelled as some of the highways of the neighbourhood,
but, since railways were made, it has been quieter
than before, and the grass has begun to creep over it a little in
some places. It leads through a district which has always been
a kind of weird region to me. And I have wandered among
those lonely moorland hills above Birtle, and Ashworth, and
Bagslate; up to the crest of old Knowl, and over the wild top
of Rooley, from whence the greatest part of South Lancashire&mdash;that
wonderful region of wealth and energy&mdash;lies under the eye,
from Blackstone Edge to the Irish Sea; and I have wandered
through the green valleys and silent glens, among those hills,
communing with the "shapes, and sounds, and shifting elements"
of nature, in many a quiet trance of meditative joy; when the
serenity of the scene was unmixed with any ruder sounds than
the murmurs and gurglings of the mountain stream, careering
over its rocky bed through the hollow of the vale; and the
music of small birds among the woods which lined the banks;
or the gambols of the summer wind among the rustling green,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
which canopied the lonely stream, so thickly that the flood of
sunshine which washed the tree-tops in gold, only stole into
the deeps in fitful threads; hardly giving a warmer tinge to the
softened light in cool grots down by the water side. Romantic
Spoddenlond! Country of wild beauty; of hardy, simple life;
of old-world manners, and of ancient tales and legends dim!
There was a time when the very air of the district seemed, to
my young mind, impregnated with boggart-lore, and all the wild
"gramerie" of old Saxon superstition,&mdash;when I looked upon it
as the last stronghold of the fairies; where they would remain
impregnable, haunting wild "thrutches" and sylvan "chapels,"
in lonely deeps of its cloughs and woods; still holding their
mystic festivals there on moonlight nights, and tripping to the
music of its waters, till the crack of doom. And, for all
the boasted march of intellect, it is, even to this day, a district
where the existence of witches, and the power of witch-doctors,
wisemen, seers, planet-rulers, and prognosticators, find great
credence in the imaginations of a rude and unlettered people.
There is a little fold, called "Prickshaw," in this township
of Spotland, which fold was the home of a notable country
astrologer, in Tim Bobbin's time, called "Prickshaw Witch."
Tim tells a humourous story about an adventure he had with
this Prickshaw planet-ruler, at the Angel Inn, in Rochdale.
Prickshaw keeps up its old oracular fame in that moorland
quarter to this day, for it has its planet-ruler still; and, it
is not alone in such wild, outlying nooks of the hills that
these professors of the art of divination may yet be found;
almost every populous town in Lancashire has, in some corner
of it, one or more of these gifted star-readers, searching out the
hidden things of life, to all inquirers, at about a shilling a-head.
These country soothsayers mostly drive a sort of contraband
trade in their line, in as noiseless and secret a way as possible,
among the most ignorant and credulous part of the population.
And it is natural that they should flourish wherever there are
minds combining abundance of ignorant faith and imagination
with a plentiful lack of knowledge. But they are not all
skulkers these diviners of the skies, for now and then a bold
prophet stands forth, in distinct proportions, before the public
gaze, who has more lofty and learned pretentions; witness
the advertisement of Dr. Alphonso Gazelle, of No. 4, Sparth
Bottoms, Rochdale, which appears in the <i>Rochdale Sentinel</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of the 3rd of December, 1853.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Oh, departed Lilly and
Agrippa; your shadows are upon us still! But I must continue
my story of the lone old road, and its associations;
and as I wandered on that cold and silent night, under the
blue sky, where night's candles were burning, so clear and
calm, I remembered that this was the country of old Adam
de Spotland, who, many centuries since, piously bequeathed
certain broad acres of land, "for the cure of souls," in the parish
of Rochdale. He has, now, many centuries slept with his fathers.
And as I walked down the road, in this sombre twilight,
with a hushed wind, and under the shade of the woody height
on which the homestead of the brave old Saxon stood, my footsteps
sounding clear in the quiet air, and the very trees seeming
to bend over to one another, and commune in awful murmurs
on the approach of an intruder, how could I tell what the tramp
of my unceremonious feet might waken there? The road crosses
a deep and craggy glen, called "Simpson Clough," which is
one of the finest pieces of ravine scenery in the county, little
as it is known. The entire length of this wild gorge is nearly
three miles, and it is watered by a stream from the hills,
called "Nadin Water," which, in seasons of heavy rain, rages
and roars with great violence, through its rocky channels.
There is many a strange old tale connected with this clough.
Half way up a shaley bank, which overhangs the river on
the western side of the clough, the mouth of an ancient lead
mine may still be seen, partly shrouded by brushwood. Upon
the summit of a precipitous steep of wildwood and rock, which
bounds the eastern side of the clough, stands Bamford Hall,
a handsome, modern building of stone, a few yards from the
site of the old hall of the Bamfords of Bamford. The new
building is a residence of one branch of the Fenton family,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
wealthy bankers and cotton spinners, and owners of large tracts
of land, here and elsewhere. On an elevated table-land, at the
western side of the clough, and nearly opposite to Bamford Hall,
stood the ancient mansion of Grizlehurst, the seat of the notable
family of Holt, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. The Holt
family were once the most powerful and wealthy landowners in
the parish of Rochdale. The principal seats of the family in
this parish were Stubley Hall, in the township of Wardleworth,
and Castleton Hall, in the township of Castleton. The manor
of Spotland was granted by Henry VIII., to Thomas Holt, who
was knighted in Scotland, by Edward, Earl of Hertford, in the
thirty-sixth year of the reign of that monarch. Part of a
neighbouring clough still bears the name of "Tyrone's Bed,"
from the tradition that Hugh O'Neal, Earl of Tyrone and
King of Ulster, took shelter in these woody solitudes, after
his defeat in the great Irish Rebellion, in the reign of Queen
Elizabeth. Mr. John Roby, of Rochdale, has woven this legend
into an elegant romance, in his "Traditions of Lancashire."</p>

<p>I reached home about ten o'clock, and, thinking over the
incidents of my walk, I was a little impressed by one fact,
suggested by the conversation at the roadside public-house, with
"Jone o'Jeffrey's," and the old couple; namely, that there is a
great outlying mass of dumb folk in this country, who&mdash;by
low social condition, but more by lack of common education
among them&mdash;are shut out from the chance of hearing
much, and still more from the chance of understanding
what little they do hear, respecting the political questions
of the time; and, also, with respect to many other matters
which are of essential importance to their welfare. Whether
this ignorance which yet pervades a great proportion of the
poor of England, is chargeable upon that multitude itself,
or upon that part of the people whom more favourable circumstances
have endowed with light and power, and who
yet withhold these elements from their less fortunate fellows,
or, whether it is chargeable upon neither, let casuists decide.
The fact that this ignorance does exist among the poor of
England, lies so plainly upon the surface of society, that it can
only be denied by those who are incurious as to the condition of
the humbler classes of this kingdom; or, by those who move
in such exclusive circles of life, that they habitually ignore the
conditions of human existence which lie outside of their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
limits of society and sympathy; or, by such as wink their
eyes to the truth of this matter, in order to work out some
small purpose of their own. Wherever there is ignorance at all
there is too much of it; and it cannot be too soon removed,
especially by those who are wise enough to see the crippling
malignities of its nature. That portion of our population
which hears next to nothing, and understands less, of politics
and the laws&mdash;any laws whatever&mdash;is nevertheless compelled
to obey the laws, right or wrong, and whatever strange mutations
they may be subject to; and is thus continually drifted
to and fro by conflicting currents of legislation which it cannot
see; currents of legislation which sometimes rise from sources
where there exists, unfortunately, more love for ruling than for
enlightening. Many changes come over the social condition of
this blind multitude, they know not whence, nor how, nor why.
The old song says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Remember, when the judgment's weak,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The prejudice is strong.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>And, certainly, that part of the popular voice which is raised
upon questions respecting which it has little or no sound information,
must be considerably swayed by prejudice, and by that
erratic play of unenlightened feeling, which has no safer government
than the ephemeral circumstances which chase each other
off the field of time. Shrewd demagogues know well how
prostrate is the position of this uneducated "mass," as it is
called; and they have a stock of old-fashioned tricks, by which
they can move it to their own ends "as easy as lying." He who
knows the touches of this passive instrument, can make it discourse
the music he desires; and, unhappily, that is not always
airs from heaven.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">'Tis the time's plague,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When madmen lead the blind.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>Now, the educated classes have all the wide field of ancient
learning open to them&mdash;they can pasture where they will; and,
the stream of present knowledge rushing by, they can drink as
they list. Whatever is doing in politics, too, they hear of, whilst
these things are yet matters of public dispute; and, in some
degree, they understand and see the drift of them, and, therefore,
can throw such influence as in them lies into one or the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
scale of the matter. This boasted out-door parliament&mdash;this
free expression of public opinion in England, however, as I have
said before, goes no farther down among the people than education
goes. Below that point lies a land of fretful slaves, dungeoned off
by ignorance from the avenues which lead to freedom; and they
drag out their lives in unwilling subservience to a legislation
which is beyond their influence. Their ignorance keeps them
dumb; and, therefore, their condition and wants are neither so
well known, nor so often nor so well expressed as those of the
educated classes. They seldom complain, however, until the
state of affairs drives them to great extremity, and then their
principal exponents are mobs, and uproars of desperation. It
is plain that where there is society there must be law, and
obedience to that law must be enforced, even among those
who know nothing of the law, as well as those who defy it; but
my principal quarrel is with that ignorant condition of theirs
which shuts them out from any reasonable hope of exercising
their rights as men and citizens. And so long as that ignorance
is <i>unnecessarily</i> continued, the very enforcement of laws
among them, the nature of which they have no chance of
knowing, looks, to me, like injustice. I see a remarkable difference,
however, between the majority of popular movements
which have agitated the people for some time past, and that
successful one&mdash;the repeal of the corn-laws. The agitation
of that question, I believe, awakened and enlisted a greater
breadth of the <i>understanding sympathy</i> of the nation, among all
classes, than was ever brought together upon any one popular
question which has been agitated within the memory of man.
But it did more than this&mdash;and herein lies one of the foundationstones
which shall hold it firm awhile, I think; since it has
passed into law, its effects have most efficiently convinced that
uneducated multitude of the labouring poor, who could not
very well understand, and did not care much for the mere
disputation of the question. Everybody has a stomach of some
sort&mdash;and it frequently happens that when the brain is not very
active the stomach is particularly so&mdash;so that, where it could not
penetrate the understanding, it has by this time triumphantly
reached the stomach, and now sits there, smiling defiance to any
kind of sophistry that would coax it thenceforth again. The
loaves of free trade followed the tracts of the League, and the
hopes of protectionist philosophers are likely to be "adjourned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
<i>sine die</i>," for this generation at least&mdash;perhaps for ever; for the
fog is clearing up a little, and I think I see, in the distance, a
better education getting ready for the next generation.</p>

<p class="drop-capi1"><span class="smcap">It</span> is not in its large towns that the true type of the
natives of Lancashire can be seen. The character of
its town population is greatly modified by mixture
with settlers from distant quarters. Not so in the
country parts, because the tenancy of land, and employment
upon it, are sufficiently competed by the natives; and while
temptations to change of settlement are fewer, the difficulties in
the way of changing settlement are greater there than in towns.
Country people, too, stick to their old sod, with hereditary love,
as long as they can keep soul and body together upon it, in any
honest way. As numbers begin to press upon the means of
living, the surplus fights its way in cities, or in foreign lands; or
lingers out a miserable life in neglected corners, for want of
work, and want of means to fly, in time, to a market where it
might, at least, exchange its labour for its living. The growth
of manufacture and railways, and the inroads of hordes of
destitute, down-trodden Irish, are stirring up Lancashire, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
changing its features, in a surprising way; and this change is
rapidly augmenting by a varied infusion of new human elements,
attracted from all quarters of the kingdom by the immense
increase of capital, boldly and promptly embarked in new inventions,
and ever-developing appliances of science, by a people
remarkable for enterprise and industry. Still, he who wishes to
see the genuine descendants of those old Saxons who came over
here some fourteen hundred years ago, to help the Britons of that
day to fight for their land, and remained to farm it, and govern
in it, let them ramble through the villages on the western side
of Blackstone Edge. He will there find the open manners, the
independent bearing, the steady perseverance, and that manly
sense of right and wrong, which characterised their Teutonic
forefathers. There, too, he will find the fair comeliness, and
massive physical constitution of those broad-shouldered farmer-warriors,
who made a smiling England out of an island of forests
and bogs&mdash;who felled the woods, and drained the marshes, and
pastured their quiet kine in the ancient lair of the wild bull, the
boar, and the wolf.</p>

<p>Milnrow is an old village, a mile and a half eastward from
the Rochdale station. The external marks of its antiquity are
now few, and much obscured by the increase of manufacture
there; but it is, for many reasons, well worth a visit. It is
part of the fine township of Butterworth, enriched with many a
scene of mountain beauty. A hardy moor-end race, half farmers,
half woollen-weavers, inhabit the district; and their rude, but
substantial cottages and farmsteads, often perch picturesquely
about the summits and sides of the hills, or nestle pleasantly
in green holms and dells, which are mostly watered by rivulets,
from the moorland heights which bound the township
on the east. There is also a beautiful lake, three miles in
circumference, filling a green valley, up in the hills, about a
mile and a half from the village. Flocks of sea-fowl often rest
on this water, in their flight from the eastern to the western
seas. From its margin the view of the wild ridges of the "Back-bone
of England" is fine to the north, while that part of it
called "Blackstone Edge" slopes up majestically from the cart-road
that winds along the eastern bank. A massive cathedral-looking
crag frowns on the forehead of the mountain. This
rock is a great point of attraction to ramblers from the vales
below, and is called by them "Robin Hood Bed." A square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
cavity in the lower part is called "Th' Cellar." Hundreds of
names are sculptured on the surface of the rock, some in most
extraordinary situations; and often have the keepers of the moor
been startled at peep of summer dawn by the strokes of an
adventurous chiseller, hammering his initials into its hard face
as stealthily as possible. But the sounds float, clear as a bell,
miles over the moor, in the quiet of the morning, and disturb
the game. One of the favourite rambles of my youth was
from Rochdale town, through that part of Butterworth which
leads by "Clegg Hall," commemorated in Roby's tradition of
"Clegg Ho' Boggart," and thence across the green hills, by
the old farmhouse, called "Peanock," and, skirting along the
edge of this quiet lake&mdash;upon whose waters I have spent many a
happy summer day, alone&mdash;up the lofty moorside beyond, to
this rock, called "Robin Hood Bed," upon the bleak summit
of Blackstone Edge. It is so large that it can be seen at a
distance of four miles by the naked eye, on a clear day. The
name of Robin Hood, that brave outlaw of the olden time&mdash;"The
English ballad-singer's joy"&mdash;is not only wedded to this
wild crag, but to at least one other congenial spot in this
parish; where the rude traditions of the people point out
another rock, of several tons weight, as having been thrown
thither, by this king of the green-woods, from an opposite
hill, nearly seven miles off. The romantic track where the lake
lies, is above the level of Milnrow, and quite out of the ordinary
way of the traveller; who is too apt to form his opinion of the
features of the whole district, from the sterile sample he sees on
the sides of the rail, between Manchester and Rochdale. But if
he wishes to know the country and its inhabitants, he must get
off that, "an' tak th' crow-gate," and he will find vast moors,
wild ravines, green cloughs, and dells, and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Shallow rivers, to whose falls,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Melodious birds sing madrigals,</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>which will repay him for his pains. And then, if he be a Lancashire
man, and a lover of genius, let him go to Milnrow&mdash;it
was the dwelling-place of Tim Bobbin, with whose works I hope
he is not unacquainted. His written works are not much in
extent. He was a painter, and his rough brush was replete with
Hogarthian sketches, full of nature, and radiant with his own
broad, humourous originality. He also left a richly-humourous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
dialectic tale, a few Hudibrastic poems and letters, characteristic
of the sterling quality of his heart and head, and just serving to
show us how much greater the man was than his book.</p>

<p>I was always proud of Tim, and in my early days have made
many a pilgrimage to the village where he used to live, wandering
home again through the green hills of Butterworth. Bent on
seeing the place once more, I went up to Hunt's Bank, one fine
day at the end of last hay-time, to catch the train to Rochdale.
I paid my shilling, and took my seat among a lot of hearty
workmen and country-folk coming back from Wales and the
bathing places on the Lancashire coast. The season had
been uncommonly fine, and the trippers looked brighter for
their out, and, to use their own phrase, felt "fain at they'rn
wick," and ready to buckle to work again, with fresh vigour.
The smile of summer had got into the saddest of us a
little; and we were communicative and comfortable. A long-limbed
collier lad, after settling his body in a corner, began to
hum, in a jolting metre, with as much freedom of mind as if he
was at the mouth of a lonely "breast-hee" on his native moorside,
a long country ditty about the courtship of Ph&oelig;be and Colin:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well met, dearest Ph&oelig;be, oh, why in such haste?</span><br />
<span class="i0">The fields and the meadows all day I have chased,</span><br />
<span class="i0">In search of the fair one who does me disdain,</span><br />
<span class="i0">You ought to reward me for all my past pain.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>The late-comers, having rushed through the ticket-office into the
carriages, were wiping their foreheads, and wedging themselves
into their seats, in spite of many protestations about being "to
full o'ready." The doors were slammed, the bell rung, the
tickets were shown, the whistle screamed its shrill signal, and off
we went, like a street on wheels, over the little Irk, that makes
such a slushy riot under the wood bridge by the college wall.
Within the memory of living men, the angler used to come
down the bank, and settle himself among the grass, to fish
in its clear waters. But since Arkwright set this part of the
world so wonderfully astir with his practicable combination of
other men's inventions, the Irk, like the rest of South Lancashire
streams, has been put to work, and its complexion is now so
"subdued to what it works in," that the angler comes no more
to the banks of the Irk to beguile the delicate loach, and the
lordly trout in his glittering suit of silver mail.</p>

<p>The train is now nearly a mile past Miles Platting, and about
a mile over the fields, on the north side, lies the romantic dell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
called "Boggart Hole Clough," hard by the village of Blackley&mdash;a
pleasant spot for an afternoon walk from Manchester. An
old Lancashire poet lives near it, too, in his country cottage.
It is a thousand to one that, like me, the traveller will see
neither the one nor the other from the train; but, like me, let
him be thankful for both, and ride on. Very soon, now, appears,
on the south side of the line, the skirts of Oldham town, scattered
about the side and summit of a barren slope, with the
tower of the parish church, peeping up between the chimneys of
the cotton factories behind Oldham Edge. If the traveller can
see no fine prospective meaning in the manufacturing system,
he will not be delighted with the scene; for the country has a
monotonous look, and is bleak and sterile, with hardly anything
worthy of the name of a tree to be seen upon it. But now,
about a hundred yards past the Oldham Station, there is a little
of the picturesque for him to feast on. We are crossing a green
valley, running north and south. Following the rivulet through
the hollow, a thick wood waves on a rising ground to the south.
In that wood stands Chadderton Hall, anciently the seat of the
Chaddertons, some of whom were famous men; and since
then, the seat of the Horton family. The situation is very
pleasant, and the land about it looks richer than the rest of the
neighbourhood. There was a deer-park here in the time of the
Hortons. Chadderton is a place of some note in the history
of the county; and it is said to have formerly belonged to one
of the old orders of knighthood. On the other side of the line,
about a mile and a half off, the south-east end of Middleton is
in sight; with its old church on the top of a green hill. The
greater part of the parish of Middleton, with other possessions
in South Lancashire, belonging to the Ashetons from
before Richard III., when extraordinary powers were granted
to Randulph Asheton. The famous Sir Ralph Asheton, called
"The Black Lad," from his wearing black armour, is traditionally
said to have ruled in his territories in South Lancashire with
great severity. In the town of Ashton, one of the lordships of
this family, his name is still remembered with a kind of hereditary
dislike; and till within the last five or six years he has been shot
and torn to pieces, in effigy, by the inhabitants, at the annual
custom of "The Riding of the Black Lad." The hero of the
fine ballad called "The Wild Rider," written by Bamford, the
Lancashire poet, was one of this family. The Middleton estates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
in 1776, failing male issue, passed by marriage into the noble
families of De Wilton and Suffield. Now, many a rich cotton
spinner, perhaps lineally descended from some of the villain-serfs
of the "Black Lad," has an eye to buying the broad lands of the
proud old Ashetons.</p>

<p>The train is now hard by Blue Pits Station, where it is not
impossible for the traveller to have to wait awhile. But he
may comfort himself with the assurance that it is not often
much more than half an hour or so. Let him amuse himself,
meanwhile, with the wild dins that fill his ears;&mdash;the shouting
and running of porters, the screams of engine-whistles, the jolts
and collisions on a small scale, and the perpetual fuff-fuff of
trains, of one kind or other, that shoot to and fro by his window,
then stop suddenly, look thoughtful, as if they had dropt something,
and run back again. If he looks out, ten to one he will
see a red-hot monster making towards him from the distance
at a great speed, belching steam, and scattering sparks and
red-hot cinders; and, in the timidity of the moment, he may
chance to hope it is on the right pair of rails. But time and a
brave patience delivers him from these terrors, unshattered in
everything&mdash;if his temper holds good&mdash;and he shoots ahead again.</p>

<p>The moorland hills now sail upon the sight, stretching from
the round peak of Knowl, on the north-west, to the romantic
heights of Saddleworth on the south-east. The train is three
minutes from Rochdale, but, before it reaches there, let the
traveller note that picturesque old mansion, on the green, above
Castleton Clough, at the left-hand side of the rail. His eye
must be active, for, at the rate he is going, the various objects
about him literally "come like shadows, so depart." This is
Castleton Hall, formerly a seat of the Holts, of Stubley, an
ancient and powerful family in this parish, in the reign of
Henry VIII. Castleton Hall came afterwards into the possession
of Humphrey Chetham, the founder of Chetham College,
in Manchester. Since then it has passed into other hands;
but the proverb, "as rich as a Chetham o' Castleton," is
often used by the people of this district, at this day; and many
interesting anecdotes, characteristic of the noble qualities of this
old Lancashire worthy, are treasured up by the people of those
parts of the country where he lived; especially in the neighbourhoods
of Clayton Hall, near Manchester, and Turton
Tower, near Bolton, his favourite residences. Castleton Hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
was an interesting place to me when I was a lad. As I pass by
it now I sometimes think of the day when I first sauntered down
the shady avenue, which leads to it from the highroad behind;
and climbed up a mossy wall by the wayside, to look into the
green gloom of a mysterious wood, which shades the rear of the
building. Even now, I remember the flush of imaginations
which came over me then. I had picked up some scraps of
historic lore about the hall, which deepened the interest I felt in
it. The solemn old rustling wood; the quaint appearance, and
serene dignity of the hall; and the spell of interest which
lingers around every decaying relic of the works and haunts
of men of bygone times, made the place eloquent to me. It
seemed to me, then, like a monumental history of its old
inhabitants, and their times. I remember, too, that I once
got a peep into a part of the hall, where in those days, some
old armour hung against the wall, silent and rusty enough, but,
to me, teeming with tales of chivalry and knightly emprise.
But, here is Rochdale station, where he, who wishes to visit the
village of Milnrow, had better alight.</p>

<p>If the traveller had time and inclination to go down into
Rochdale town, he might see some interesting things, old and
new, there. The town is more picturesquely situated than most
of the towns of South Lancashire. It lines the sides of a deep
valley on the banks of the Roch, overlooked by moorland hills. In
Saxon times it was an insignificant village, called "Rocheddam,"
consisting of a few rural dwellings in Church Lane, a steep and
narrow old street, which was, down to the middle of last
century, the principal street in the town, though now the
meanest and obscurest. The famous John Bright, the Cromwell
of modern politicians&mdash;a man of whom future generations of
Englishmen will be prouder even than his countrymen are now&mdash;was
born in this town, and lives at "One Ash," on the north
side of it. John Roby, author of the "Traditions of Lancashire,"
was a banker, in Rochdale, of the firm of Fenton and Roby.
The bank was next door to the shop of Thomas Holden, the
principal bookseller of the town, to whom I was apprentice.
For the clergy of the district, and for a certain class of politicians,
this shop was the chief rendezvous of the place. Roby used to
slip in at evening, to have a chat with my employer, and a knot
of congenial spirits who met him there. In the days when my
head was yet but a little way higher than the counter, I remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
how I used to listen to his versatile conversations. Rochdale
was one of the few places where the woollen manufacture
was first practised in England. It is still famous for its
flannel. The history of Rochdale is in one respect but the
counterpart of that of almost every other South Lancashire
town. With the birth of cotton manufacture, it shot up
suddenly into one of the most populous and wealthy country
towns in England. After the traveller has contemplated the
manufacturing might of the place, he may walk up the
quaint street from which the woollen merchants of old used
to dispatch their goods, on pack horses, to all parts of
the kingdom; and from which it takes the name of "Packer
Street." At the top, a flight of one hundred and twenty-two
steps leads into the churchyard; which commands an excellent
view of the town below. There, too, lies "Tim Bobbin."
Few Lancashire strangers visit the town without looking at the
old rhymer's resting-place. Bamford, author of "Passages in the
Life of a Radical," thus chronicles an imaginary visit to Tim's
grave, in happy imitation of the dialect of the neighbourhood:&mdash;</p>

<p>Some of the epitaphs on the grave-stones were written by Tim.
The following one, on Joe Green, the sexton, is published with
Tim's works:&mdash;</p>

<p>Near to this grave is the grave of Samuel Kershaw, blacksmith,

<p>"Blind Abraham," who rang the curfew, and who used to
imitate the chimes of Rochdale old church, in a wonderful
way, for the lads at the Grammar School, could lead a
stranger from any point of the churchyard, straight as an
arrow's flight, to Tim's gravestone. The Grammar School
was founded in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, by Archbishop
Parker. The parish church is an interesting old edifice, standing
on the edge of an eminence, which overlooks the town. Tradition
says its foundations were laid by "Goblin Builders."
The living was anciently dependent on the Abbey of Whalley.
It is now the richest vicarage in the kingdom. A short walk
through the glebe lands, and past "Th' Cant-hill Well,"<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> west
of the vicarage, will bring the traveller to the hill on which,
in 1080, stood the castle of Gamel, the Saxon Thane, above the
valley called "Kill-Danes," where the northern pirates once lost
a great fight with the Saxon.</p>

<p>After spending a few days in the town, I set out for Milnrow,
one fine afternoon. The road leads by the "Railway
Inn," near the station. The hay was mostly gathered in, but
the smell of it still lingered on the meadows, and perfumed the
wind, which sung a low melody among the leaves of the hedges.
Along the vale of the Roch, to the left, lay a succession of
manufacturing villages, with innumerable mills, collieries, farmsteads,
mansions, and cottages, clustering in the valley, and
running up into the hills in all directions, from Rochdale to
Littleborough, a distance of three miles. As I went on I was
reminded of "wimberry-time," by meeting knots of flaxen-headed
lads and lasses from the moors, with their baskets filled,
and mouths all stained with the juice of that delicious moorland
fruit. There are many pleasant customs in vogue here at this
season. The country-folk generally know something of local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
botany; and gather in a stock of medicinal herbs to dry, for use
throughout the year. There is still some "spo'in'" at the
mineral springs in the hills. Whether these springs are really
remarkable for peculiar mineral virtues, or what these peculiar
virtues are, I am not prepared to say; but it is certain that
many of the inhabitants of this district firmly believe in their
medicinal qualities, and, at set seasons of the year, go forth to
visit these springs, in jovial companies, to drink "spo wayter."
Some go with great faith in the virtues of the water, and, having
drunk well of it, they will sometimes fill a bottle with it, and
ramble back to their houses, gathering on their way edible herbs,
such as "payshun docks," and "green-sauce," or "a burn o'
nettles," to put in their broth, and, of which, they also make a
wholesome "yarb-puddin'," mixed with meal; or they scour
the hill-sides in search of "mountain flax," a "capital yarb for
a cowd;" and for the herb called "tormental," which, I have
heard them say, grows oftenest "abeawt th' edge o' th' singing
layrock neest;" or they will call upon some country botanist to
beg a handful of "Solomon's seal," to "cure black e'en wi'." But
some go to these springs mainly for the sake of a pleasant stroll
and a quiet feast. One of the most noted of these "spo'in'"
haunts is "Blue Pots Spring," situated upon a lofty moorland,
at the head of a green glen, called "Long Clough," about
three miles from the village of Littleborough. The ancient
Lancashire festival of "Rushbearing," and the hay-harvest,
fall together, in the month of August; and make it a pleasant
time of the year to the folk of the neighbourhood. At about
a mile on the road to Milnrow, the highway passes close by
a green dingle, called "Th' Gentlewoman's Nook," which is
someway connected with the unfortunate fate of a lady, once
belonging to an influential family, near Milnrow. Some of the
country people yet believe that the place is haunted; and, when
forced to pass it after dark has come on, they steal fearfully
and hastily by.</p>

<p>About a mile on the road stands Belfield Hall, on the site of
an ancient house, formerly belonging to the Knights of St. John
of Jerusalem. It is a large old building, belonging to the Townley
family. The estate has been much improved by its present
occupant, and makes a pleasant picture in the eye from the top
of a dinge in the road, at the foot of which a by-path leads up
to the old village of Newbold, on the brow of a green bank, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the right-hand side of the highway. I stood there a minute, and
tried to plant again the old woods, that must have been thick
there, when the squirrel leaped from tree to tree, from Castletor
Hall to Buckley Wood. I was trying to shape in imagination
what the place looked like in the old time, when the first rude
hall was built upon the spot, and the country around was a lonesome
tract, shrouded by primeval trees, when a special train
went snorting by the back of the hall, and shivered my delicate
endeavour to atoms. I sighed involuntarily; but bethinking me
how imagination clothes all we are leaving behind in a drapery
that veils many of its rough realities, I went my way, thankful
for things as they are. A little further on, Fir Grove bridge
crosses the Rochdale canal, and commands a better view of the
surrounding country. I rested here a little while, and looked
back upon the spot which is for ever dear to my remembrance.
The vale of the Roch lay smiling before me, and the wide-stretching
circle of dark hills closed in the landscape, on all sides,
except the south-west. Two weavers were lounging on the
bridge, bareheaded, and in their working gear, with stocking-legs
drawn on their arms. They had come out of the looms to
spend their "baggin-time" in the open air, and were humming
one of their favourite songs:&mdash;</p>

<p>At the door of the Fir Grove ale-house, a lot of raw-boned
young fellows were talking with rude emphasis about the
exploits of a fighting-cock of great local renown, known by the
bland sobriquet of "Crash-Bwons." The theme was exciting,
and in the course of it they gesticulated with great vehemence,
and, in their own phrase, "swore like horse-swappers." Some
were colliers, and sat on the ground, in that peculiar squat,
with the knees up to a level with the chin, which is a favourite
resting-attitude with them. At slack times they like to sit
thus by the road side, and exchange cracks over their ale,
amusing themselves meanwhile by trying the wit and temper of
every passer by. These humourous road-side commentators are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
generally, the roughest country lads of the neighbourhood, who
have no dislike to anybody willing to accommodate them with
a tough battle; for they, like the better regulated portion of the
inhabitants of the district, are hardy, bold, and independent;
and, while their manners are open and blunt, their training and
amusements are very rough.</p>

<p>I was now approaching Milnrow; and, here and there, a tenter-field
ribbed the landscape with lines of woollen webs, hung upon
the hooks to dry. Severe laws were anciently enacted for the
protection of goods thus necessarily exposed. Depredations on
such property were punished after the manner of that savage old
"Maiden" with the thin lip, who stood so long on the "Gibbet
Hill," at Halifax, kissing evil-doers out of the world. Much of
the famous Rochdale flannel is still woven by the country people
here, in the old-fashioned, independent way, at their own homes,
as the traveller will see by "stretchers," which are used for
drying their warps upon, so frequently standing at the doors of
the roomy dwelling-houses near the road. From the head of the
brow which leads down into the village, Milnrow chapel is full
in view on a green hill-side to the left, overlooking the centre of
the busy little hamlet. It is a bald-looking building from the
distance, having more the appearance of a little square factory
than a church. Lower down the same green eminence, which
slopes to the edge of the little river Beal, stands the pleasant and
tasteful, but modest residence of the incumbent of Milnrow, the
Rev. Francis Robert Raines, honorary canon of Manchester, a
notable archæologist and historian; much beloved by the people
of the locality.</p>

<p>There are old people still living in Milnrow, who were
taught to read and write, and "do sums" in Tim Bobbin's school;
yet, the majority of the inhabitants seem unacquainted with his
residence. I had myself been misled respecting it; but having
obtained correct information, and a reference from a friend in
Rochdale to an old relative of his who lived in the veritable
cottage of renowned Tim, I set about inquiring for him. As I
entered the village, I met a sturdy, good-looking woman, with
a chocolate-coloured silk kerchief tied over her snowy cap, in
that graceful way which is known all over the country-side as
a "Mildro Bonnet." She stopt me and said, "Meastur, hea fur
han yo com'd?" "From Rochdale." "Han yo sin aught ov
a felley wi breeches on, an' rayther forrud, upo' th' gate, between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
an' th' Fir Grove?" I told her I had not; and I then inquired
for Scholefield that lived in Tim Bobbin's cottage. She
reckoned up all the people she knew of that name, but none of
them answering the description, I went on my way. I next
asked a tall woollen-weaver, who was striding up the street with
his shuttle to the mending. Scratching his head, and looking
thoughtfully round among the houses, he said, "Scwofil? Aw
know no Scwofils, but thoose at th' Tim Bobbin aleheawse;
yodd'n better ash (ask) theer." Stepping over to the Tim Bobbin
inn, Mrs. Schofield described to me the situation of Tim's cottage,
near the bridge. Retracing my steps towards the place, I went
into the house of an old acquaintance of my childhood. On
the strength of a dim remembrance of my features, he invited
me to sit down, and share the meal just made ready for the
family. "Come, poo a cheer up," said he, "an' need no moo
lathein'."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> After we had finished, he said, "Neaw, win yd
have a reech o' bacco? Mally, reytch us some pipes, an th'
pot out o'th nook. Let's see, who's lad are yo, sen yo? for aw
welly forgetten, bith mass." After a fruitless attempt at enlightening
him thereon in ordinary English, I took to the
dialect, and in the country fashion described my genealogy, on
the mother's side. I was instantly comprehended; for he stopt
me short with&mdash;"Whau then, aw'll be sunken iv yo are not
gron'son to 'Billy, wi' th' pipes, at th' Biggins.'" "Yo han it
neaw," said I. "Eh," replied he, "aw knowed him as weel as
aw knew my own feythur! He're a terrible chap for music, an'
sich like; an' he used to letter grave-stones, an' do mason-wark.
Eh, aw've bin to mony a orrytory wi' Owd Billy. Why,&mdash;let's
see&mdash;Owd Wesley preytched at his heawse, i' Wardle fowd
once't.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> An' han yo some relations i' th' Mildro, then?" I told
him my errand, and inquired for Scholefield, who lived in Tim
Bobbin's cottage. As he pondered, and turned the name over
in his mind, one of his lads shouted out, "By th' mon, feyther,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
it's 'Owd Mahogany,' Aw think he's code (called) Scwofil, an'
he lives i'th garden at th' botham o'th bonk, by th' waytur side."
It was generally agreed that this was the place, so I parted with
my friends and went towards it. The old man came out without
his hat, a short distance, to set me right. After bidding me
a hearty "good neet," he turned round as he walked away, and
shouted out, "Neaw tay care yo coan, th' next time yo com'n
thiz gate, an' wi'n have a gradely do."</p>

<p>About twenty yards from the west end of the little stone
bridge that spans the river, a lane leads, between the ends of the
dwelling houses, down to the water side. There, still sweetly
secluded, stands the quaint, substantial cottage of John Collier,
in its old garden by the edge of the Beal, which, flowing through
the fields in front, towards the cottage, is there dammed up into
a reservoir for the use of the mill close by, and then tumbling
over in a noisy little fall under the garden edge, goes shouting
and frolicking along the north-east side of it, over water-worn
rocks, and under the bridge, till the cadence dies away in a low
murmur, beyond, where the bed of the stream gets smoother.
Lifting the latch, I walked through the garden, to the cottage,
where I found "Owd Mahogany" and his maiden sister, two
plain, clean, substantial working-people, who were sitting in the
low-roofed, but otherwise roomy apartment in front, used as a
kitchen. They entered heartily into the purpose of my visit,
and showed me everything about the house with a genial pride.
What made the matter more interesting was the fact, that
"Owd Mahogany" had been, when a lad, a pupil of Collier's.
The house was built expressly for Tim, by his father-in-law;
and the uncommon thickness of the walls, the number and
arrangement of the rooms, and the remains of a fine old oak
staircase, showed that more than usual care and expense had
been bestowed upon it. As we went through the rooms on
the ground-floor, my ancient guide gave me a good deal of
anecdote connected with each. Pointing to a clean, cold, whitewashed
cell, with a great flag table in it, and a grid-window at
one end, he said, "This wur his buttery, wheer he kept pullen,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
an gam, an sich like; for thir no mon i' Rachdaw parish liv't
betther nor Owd Tim, nor moor like a gentleman; nor one at
had moor friends, gentle an simple. Th' Teawnlo's took'n to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
fearfully, an thir'n olez comin' to see him; or sendin' him
presents o' some mak'." He next showed me the parlour where
he used to write and receive company. A little oblong room,
low in the roof, and dimly lighted by a small window from the
garden. Tim used to keep this retiring sanctum tastefully adorned
with the flowers of each season, and one might have eaten his
dinner off the floor in his time. In the garden he pointed out
the corner where Tim had a roomy green arbor, with a smooth
stone table in the middle, on which lay his books, his flute, or
his meals, as he was in the mood. He would stretch himself
out here, and muse for hours together. The lads used to bring
their tasks from the school behind the house, to this arbor,
for Tim to examine. He had a green shaded walk from
the school into his garden. When in the school, or about
the house, he wore a silk velvet skull-cap. The famous
radical, William Cobbett, used to wear a similar one, occasionally;
and I have heard those who have seen both in this
trim, say that the likeness of the two men was then singularly
striking. "Owd Mahogany" having now shown and told me
many interesting things respecting Tim's house and habits,
entered into a hearty eulogy upon his character as a man and a
schoolmaster. "He're a fine, straight-forrud mon, wi' no maffle
abeawt him; for o' his quare, cranky ways." As an author, he
thought him "Th' fine'st writer at Englan' bred, at that time o'
th' day." Of his caligraphy, too, he seemed particularly proud,
for he declared that "Tim could write a clear print hond, as
smo' as smithy smudge," He finished by saying, that he saw him
carried out of the door-way we were standing in, to his grave.</p>

<p>At the edge of dark, I bade adieu to Tim's cottage, and the
comfortable old couple that live in it. As I looked back from
the garden-gate, the house wore a plaintive aspect, in my imagination;
as if it was thinking of its fine old tenant. Having heard
that there was something uncommon to be learnt of him at the
Tim Bobbin Inn, I went there again. It is the largest and most
respectable public-house in the village, kept in a fine state of
homely comfort by a motherly old widow. I found that she
could tell me something of the quaint schoolmaster and his wife
"Mary," who, as she said, "helped to bring her into th' world."
She brought out a folio volume of engravings from designs by
Tim, with many pieces of prose and verse of his, in engraved
fac-simile of his hand-writing. The book was bound in dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
morocco, with the author's name on the side, in gold. I turned
it over with pleasure, for there were things in it not found in
any edition of his works. The landlady shows this book with
some pride to Tim's admirers; by some she had been offered
large sums of money for it; and once a party of curious visitors
had well-nigh carried it off by stealth in their carriage, after
making fruitless offers of purchase; but the plan was detected
in time, and the treasure restored to its proper custody. I read
in it one of his addresses to his subscribers, in which he says of
himself: "He's Lancashire born; and, by the by, all his acquaintance
agree, his wife not excepted, that he's an odd-fellow....
In the reign of Queen Anne he was a boy, and one of
the nine children of a poor curate in Lancashire, whose stipend
never amounted to thirty pounds a-year, and consequently the
family must feel the iron teeth of penury with a witness. These
indeed were sometimes blunted by the charitable disposition of
the good rector (the Rev. Mr. H.&mdash;&mdash;, of W&mdash;&mdash; n): so this
T. B. lived as some other boys did, content with water-pottage,
buttermilk, and jannock, till he was between thirteen and fourteen
years of age, when Providence began to smile on him in his
advancement to a pair of Dutch looms, when he met with treacle
to his pottage, and sometimes a little in his buttermilk, or spread
on his jannock. However, the reflections of his father's circumstances
(which now and then start up and still edge his teeth)
make him believe that Pluralists are no good Christians; that he
who will accept of two or more places of one hundred a-year,
would not say <i>I have enough</i>, though he was Pope Clement,
Urban, or Boniface,&mdash;could affirm himself infallible, and offer
his toe to kings: that the unequal distribution of Church emoluments
is as great a grievance in the ecclesiastic, as undeserved
pensions and places are in the state; both of which, he presumes
to prophesy, will prove canker-worms at the roots of those
succulent plants, and in a few years cause leaf and branch to
shrivel up, and dry them to tinder." The spirit of this passage
seems the natural growth, in such a mind as his, of the curriculum
of study in the hard college of Tim's early days. In the thrifty
home of the poor Lancashire curate, though harrowed by "the
iron teeth of penury," Tim inherited riches that wealth cannot
buy. Under the tuition of a good father, who could study his
reflective and susceptible mind, and teach him many excellent
things; together with that hard struggle to keep the wolf from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the door of his childhood, which pressed upon his thoughts, he
grew up contemplative, self-reliant, and manly, on oatmeal porridge,
and jannock, with a little treacle for a god-send. His
feelings were deepened, and his natural love of independence
strengthened there, with that hatred of all kinds of injustice,
which flashes through the rich humour and genial kindness of
his nature,&mdash;for nature was strong in him, and he relished her
realities. Poverty is not pleasant, yet the world has more to
thank poverty for than it dreams of. With honourable pride
he fought his way to a pair of Dutch looms, where he learned to
win his jannock and treacle by honest weaving. Subsequently
he endeavoured to support himself honourably, by pursuits no
less useful, but more congenial to the bias of his faculties; but,
to the last, his heart's desire was less to live in external plenty
and precedence among men, than to live conscientiously, in the
sweet relations of honourable independence in the world. This
feeling was strong in him, and gives dignity to his character.
As a politician, John Collier was considerably ahead of the time
he lived in, and especially of the simple, slow-minded race of
people dwelling, then, in that remote nook of Lancashire,
at the foot of Blackstone Edge. Among such people, and in
such a time, he spoke and wrote things, which few men dared
to write and speak. He spoke, too, in a way which was as
independent and pithy as it was quaintly-expressive. His words,
like his actions, stood upon their own feet, and looked up. Perhaps,
if he had been a man of a drier nature,&mdash;of less genial and
attractive genius than he was,&mdash;he might have had to suffer more
for the enunciation of truths, and the recognition of principles
which were unfashionable in those days. But Collier was not
only a man of considerable valour and insight, with a manly
mind and temper, but he was also genial and humourous, as he
was earnest and honest. He was an eminently human-hearted
man, who abhorred all kinds of cant and seeming. His life was
a greater honour to him even than his quaint pencil, or his pen;
and the memory of his sayings and doings will be long and
affectionately cherished, at least, by Lancashire men.</p>

<p>The following brief memoir, written by his friend and patron,
Richard Townley, Esq., of Belfield Hall, near Milnrow, for insertion
in Dr. Aiken's "History of the Environs of Manchester,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
contains the best and completest account of his life and character,
which has yet appeared:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">John Collier</span>, <i>alias</i> <span class="smcap">Tim Bobbin</span>, was born near Warrington, in Lancashire;
his father, a clergyman of the Established Church, had a small curacy, and
for several years taught a school. With the joint income of those, he managed so
as to maintain a wife and several children decently, and also to give them a tolerable
share of useful learning, until a dreadful calamity befel him, about his fortieth year&mdash;the
total loss of sight. His former intentions of bringing up his son, John&mdash;of whose
abilities he had conceived a favourable opinion&mdash;to the church, were then over, and
he placed him out an apprentice to a Dutch loom-weaver, at which business he
worked more than a year; but such a sedentary employment not at all according
with his volatile spirits and eccentric genius, he prevailed upon his master to release
him from the remainder of his servitude. Though then very young, he soon commenced
itinerant schoolmaster, going about the country from one small town to
another, to teach reading, writing, and accounts; and generally having a night-school
(as well as a day one), for the sake of those whose necessary employments
would not allow their attendance at the usual school hours.</p>

<p>In one of his adjournments to the small but populous town of Oldham, he had
an intimation that the Rev. Mr. Pearson, curate and schoolmaster, of Milnrow, near
Rochdale, wanted an assistant in the school. To that gentleman he applied, and
after a short examination, was taken in by him to the school, and he divided his
salary, twenty pounds a year, with him. This Tim considered as a material advance
in the world, as he still could have a night-school, which answered very well in that
populous neighbourhood, and was considered by Tim, too, as a state of independency;
a favourite idea, ever afterwards, with his high spirits. Mr. Pearson, not very long
afterwards, falling a martyr to the gout, my honoured father gave Mr. Collier the
school, which not only made him happy in the thought of being more independent,
but made him consider himself as a rich man.</p>

<p>Having now more leisure hours by dropping his night-school there, though he
continued to teach at Oldham, and some other places, during the vacations of
Whitsuntide and Christmas, he began to instruct himself in music and drawing,
and soon was such a proficient in both as to be able to instruct others very well
in those amusing arts.</p>

<p>The hautboy and common flute were his chief instruments, and upon the former
he very much excelled; the fine modulations that have since been acquired, or
introduced upon that noble instrument, being then unknown in England. He drew
landscapes in good taste, understanding the rules of perspective, and attempted some
heads in profile, with very decent success: but it did not hit his humour, for I have
heard him say, when urged to go on in that line, that "drawing heads and faces was
as dry and insipid as leading a life without frolic and fun, unless he was allowed to
steal in some leers of comic humour, or to give them a good dash of the caricature."
Very early in life he discovered some poetic talents, or rather an easy habit for
humourous rhyme, by several anonymous squibs he sent about in ridicule of some
notoriously absurd, or eccentric characters; these were fathered upon him very
justly, which created him some enemies, but more friends. I had once in my
possession some humourous relations in tolerable rhyme, of his own frolic and fun
with persons he met with, of the like description, in his hours of festive humour,
which was sure to take place when released for any time from school duty, and not
too much engaged in his lucrative employment of painting. The first regular poetic
composition which he published, was "The Blackbird," containing some spirited
ridicule upon a Lancashire Justice, more renowned for political zeal and ill-timed
loyalty than good sense and discretion. In point of easy, regular versification,
perhaps this was his best specimen, and it also exhibited some strokes of humour.</p>

<p>About this period of life he fell seriously in love with a handsome young woman,
a daughter of Mr. Clay, of Flockton, near Huddersfield, and soon after took her
unto him for a wife, or, as he used to style her, his crooked rib, who, in proper time,
increased his family, and proved to be a virtuous, discreet, sensible, and prudent
woman, a good wife, and an excellent mother. His family continuing to increase
nearly every year, the hautboy, flute, and amusing pencil were pretty much discarded,
and the brush and pallet taken up seriously. He was chiefly engaged for some time
in painting altar-pieces for chapels and signs for publicans, which pretty well rewarded
the labours of his vacant hours from school attendance; but after some time, family
expenses increasing more with his family, he devised, or luckily hit upon, a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
lucrative employment for his leisure hours:&mdash;this was copying Dame Nature in
some of her humourous performances, and grotesque sportings with the human face
(especially where the visage had the greatest share in those sportings), into which
his pencil contrived to throw some pointed features of grotesque humour, such as
were best adapted to excite risibility, as long as such strange objects had the advantage
of novelty to recommend them. These pieces he worked off with uncommon
celerity: a single portrait in the leisure hours of two days, at least, and a group of
three or four in a week. As soon as finished, he was wont to carry them to the first-rate
inns at Rochdale and Littleborough, in the great road to Yorkshire, with the
lowest prices fixed upon them, the innkeepers willingly becoming Tim's agents.
The droll humour, as well as singularity of style of those pieces, procured him a
most ready sale, from riders out, and travellers of other descriptions, who had heard
of Tim's character. These whimsical productions soon began to be in such general
repute, that he had large orders for them, especially from merchants in Liverpool,
who sent them, upon speculation, into the West Indies and America. He used, at
that time, to say, that "if Providence had ever meant him to be a rich man, that
would have been the proper time, especially if she had kindly bestowed upon him
two pair of hands instead of one;" but when cash came in readily, it was sure to go
merrily: a cheerful glass with a joyous companion was so much in unison with his
own disposition, that a temptation of that kind could never be resisted by poor Tim;
so the season to grow rich never arrived, but Tim remained poor Tim to the end of
the chapter.</p>

<p>Collier had been for many years collecting, not only from the rustics in his own
neighbourhood, but also wherever he made excursions, all the awkward, vulgar,
obsolete words, and local expressions, which ever occurred to him in conversation
amongst the lower classes. A very retentive memory brought them safe back for
insertion in his vocabulary, or glossary, and from thence he formed and executed
the plan of his "Lancashire Dialect," which he exhibited to public cognizance in
the "Adventures of a Lancashire Clown," formed from some rustic sports and
gambols, and also some whimsical modes of circulating fun at the expense of silly,
credulous boobies amongst the then cheery gentlemen of that peculiar neighbourhood.
This publication, from its novelty, together with some real strokes of comic
humour interlarded into it, took very much with the middle and lower class of people
in the northern counties (and I believe everywhere in the South, too, where it had
the chance of being noticed), so that a new edition was soon necessary. This was a
matter of exultation to Tim, but not of very long duration, for the rapid sale of the
second edition soon brought forth two or three pirated editions, which made the
honest, unsuspecting owner to exclaim with great vehemence, "that he did not believe
there was one honest printer in Lancashire;" and afterwards to lash some of
the most culpable of those insidious offenders with his keen, sarcastic pen, when
engaged in drawing up a preface to a future publication. The above-named performances,
with his pencil, his brush, and his pen, made Tim's name and repute for
whimsical archness pretty generally known, not only within his native county, but
also through the adjoining counties of Yorkshire and Cheshire: and his repute for a
peculiar species of pleasantry in his hours of frolic, often induced persons of much
higher rank to send for him to an inn (when in the neighbourhood of his residence),
to have a personal specimen of his uncommon drollery. Tim was seldom backward
in obeying a summons to good cheer, and seldom, I believe, disappointed the expectations
of his generous host, for he had a wonderful flow of spirits, with an inexhaustible
fund of humour, and that, too, of a very peculiar character.</p>

<p>Blest with a clear and masculine understanding, and a keen discernment into the
humours and foibles of others, he knew how to take the best advantage of those
occasional interviews in order to promote trade, as he was wont to call it, though his
natural temper was very far from being of a mercenary cast; it was often rather too
free and generous; more so than prudence, with respect to his family, would advise,
for he would sooner have had a lenten day or two at home, than done a shabby and
mean thing abroad.</p>

<p>Amongst other persons of good fortune, who often called upon him at Milnrow,
or sent for him to spend a few hours with him at Rochdale, was a Mr. Richard Hill,
of Kibroid and Halifax, in Yorkshire, then one of the greatest cloth merchants, and
also one of the most considerable manufacturers of baizes and shalloons in the north
of England. This gentleman was not only fond of his humourous conversation, but
also had taken up an opinion that he would be highly useful to him as his head clerk,
in business, from his being very ready at accounts, and writing a most beautiful
small hand, in any kind of type, but especially in imitation of printed characters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
After several fruitless attempts, he at last, by offers of an extravagant salary, prevailed
upon Mr. Collier to enter into articles of service for three years, certain, and
to take his family to Kibroid. After signing and sealing, he called upon me to give
notice that he must resign the school, and to thank me for my long-continued friendship
to him. At taking leave, he, like the honest Moor&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Albeit, unused to the melting mood,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Dropped tears as fast as the Arabian tree,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Their medicinal gum.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>And, in faltering accents, entreated me not to be too hasty in filling up the vacancy
in that school, where he had lived so many years contented and happy: for he had
already some forebodings that he should never relish his new situation and new
occupation. I granted his request, but hoped he would soon reconcile himself to his
new situation, as it promised to be so advantageous both to himself and family. He
replied, that "it was for the sake of his wife and children, that he was at last induced
to accept Mr. Hill's very tempting offers, no other consideration whatever could
have made him give up Milnrow school, and independency."</p>

<p>About two months afterwards, some business of his master's bringing him to
Rochdale market, he took that opportunity of returning by Belfield. I instantly
perceived a wonderful change in his looks: that countenance which used ever to be
gay, serene, or smiling, was then covered, or disguised with a pensive, settled gloom.
On asking him how he liked his new situation at Kibroid, he replied, "Not at all;"
then, enumerating several causes for discontent, concluded with an observation, that
"he never could abide the ways of that country, for they neither kept red-letter
days themselves nor allowed their servants to keep any." Before he left me, he
passionately entreated that I would not give away the school, for he should never be
happy again until he was seated in the crazy old elbow chair within his school. I
granted his request, being less anxious to fill up the vacancy, as there were two other
free schools for the same uses within the same townships, which have decent salaries
annexed to them.</p>

<p>Some weeks afterwards I received a letter from Tim, that he had some hopes of
getting released from his vassalage; for, that the father having found out what very
high wages his son had agreed to give him, was exceedingly angry with him for
being so extravagant in his allowance to a clerk; that a violent quarrel betwixt them
had been the consequence; and from that circumstance he meant&mdash;at least hoped&mdash;to
derive some advantage in the way of regaining his liberty, which he lingered after,
and panted for, as much as any galley-slave upon earth.</p>

<p>Another letter announced that his master perceived that he was dejected, and
had lost his wonted spirits and cheerfulness; had hinted to him, that if he disliked
his present situation, he should be released at the end of the year; concluding his
letter with a most earnest imploring that I would not dispose of the school before
that time. By the interposition of the old gentleman, and some others, he got the
agreement cancelled a considerable time before the year expired; and the evening of
the day when the liberation took place, he hired a large Yorkshire cart to bring away
bag and baggage by six o'clock next morning, to his own house, at Milnrow. When
he arrived upon the west side of Blackstone Edge, he thought himself once more a
<span class="smcap">Free Man</span>; and his heart was as light as a feather. The next morning he came up
to Belfield, to know if he might take possession of his school again; which being
readily consented to, tears of gratitude instantly streamed down his cheeks, and
such a suffusion of joy illumined his countenance, as plainly bespoke the heart being
in unison with his looks. He then declared his unalterable resolution never more to
quit the humble village of Milnrow; that it was not in the power of kings, nor their
prime ministers, to make him any offers, if so disposed, that would allure him from
his tottering elbow chair, from humble fare, with liberty and contentment. A hint
was thrown out that he must work hard with his pencil, his brush, and his pen, to
make up the deficiency in income to his family; that he promised to do, and was as
good as his promise, for he used double diligence, so that the inns at Rochdale and
Littleborough were soon ornamented, more than ever, with ugly grinning old fellows,
and mambling old women on broomsticks, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>Tim's last literary productions, as I recollect, were "Remarks upon the Rev.
Mr. Whittaker's History of Manchester, in two parts:" the "Remarks" will speak
for themselves. There appears rather too much seasoning and salt in some of them,
mixed with a degree of acerbity for which he was rather blamed.</p>

<p>Mr. Collier died in possession of his faculties, with his mental powers but little
impaired, at nearly eighty years of age, and his eyesight was not so much injured as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
might have been expected from such a severe use of it, during so long a space of
time. His wife died a few years before him, but he left three sons and two
daughters behind him.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In a sketch like this, it is not easy to select such examples
from Collier's writings as will give an adequate idea of their
manner and significance. His inimitable story, called "Tummus
and Meary," will bear no mutilation. Of his rhymes, perhaps
the best is the one called "The Blackbird." The following
extract from Tim's preface to the third edition of his works, in
the form of a dialogue between the author and his book, though
far from the best thing he has written, contains some very
characteristic touches:&mdash;</p>

<p>To a liberal and observant stranger, one of the richest results
of a visit to this quarter will arise from contemplation of the
well-defined character of the people that live in it. The whole
population is distinguished by a fine, strong, natural character,
which would do honour to the refinements of education. A
genteel stranger, who cannot read the heart of this people through
their blunt manners, will, perhaps, think them a little boorish.
But though they have not much bend in the neck, and their
rough dialect is little blest with the set phrases of courtesy, there
are no braver men in the world, and under their uncouth demeanour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
lives the spirit of true chivalry. They have a favourite
proverb, that "fair play's a jewel," and are generally careful, in
all their dealings, to act upon it. They feel a generous pride
in the man who can prove himself their master in anything.
Unfortunately, little has yet been done for them in the way of
book-education, except what has been diffused by the Sunday-schools,
since the times of their great apostle, John Wesley, who,
in person, as well as by his enthusiastic early preachers, laboured
much and earnestly among them, in many parts of South Lancashire.
Yet nature has blest them with a fine vein of mother-wit,
and has drilled some useful pages of her horn-book into them in
the loom, the mine, and the farm, for they are naturally hard
workers, and proud of honest labour. They are keen critics of
character, too, and have a sharp eye to the nooks and corners of
a stranger's attire, to see that, at least, whether rich or poor, it
be sound, and, as they say, "bothomly cleeon," for they are
jealous of dirty folk. They are accustomed to a frank expression
of what is in them, and like the open countenance, where the
time of day may be read in the dial, naturally abhorring "hudd'n
wark, an' meawse-neeses." Among the many anecdotes illustrative
of the character of this people, there is one which, though simple,
bears a strong stamp of native truth upon it. A stalwart young
fellow, who had long been employed as carter for a firm in this
neighbourhood, had an irresistible propensity to fighting, which
was constantly leading him into scrapes. He was an excellent
servant in every other respect, but no admonition could cure him
of this; and at length he was discharged, in hope to work the
desired change. Dressing himself in his best, he applied to an
eminent native merchant for a similar situation. After other
necessary questions, the merchant asked whether he had brought
his character with him. "My character!" replied our hero,
"Naw, aw'm a damned deeol better beawt it!" This anecdote
conveys a very true idea of the rough vigour and candour of the
Lancashire country population. They dislike dandyism and the
shabby-genteel, and the mere bandbox exquisite would think
them a hopeless generation. Yet, little as they are tinctured
with literature, a few remarkable books are very common among
them. I could almost venture to prophesy before going into any
substantial farmhouse, or any humble cottage in this quarter,
that some of the following books might be found there: the
Bible, Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, the Book of Common Prayer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
and often Wesley's Hymn-book, Barclay's Dictionary, Culpepper's
Herbal; and, sometimes, Thomas à Kempis, or a few old puritan
sermons. One of their chief delights is the practice of sacred
music; and I have heard the works of Haydn, Handel, Mozart,
and Beethoven executed with remarkable correctness and taste,
in the lonely farmhouses and cottages of South Lancashire.
In no other part of England does such an intense love of sacred
music pervade the poorer classes. It is not uncommon for
them to come from the farthest extremity of South Lancashire,
and even over the "Edge" from Huddersfield, and other towns
of the West Riding of Yorkshire, to hear an oratorio at the
Free Trade Hall, returning home again, sometimes a distance
of thirty miles, in the morning.</p>

<p>I will now suppose that the traveller has seen Tim Bobbin's
grave, and has strolled up by Silver Hills, through the scenery of
Butterworth, and, having partly contemplated the character of
this genuine specimen of a South Lancashire village, is again
standing on the little stone bridge which spans the pretty
river Beal. Let him turn his back to the Rochdale road a
little while; we have not done with him yet. Across the
space there, used as a fair ground at "Rushbearing time,"
stands an old-fashioned stone ale-house, called "Th' Stump and
Pie Lad," commemorating, by its scabbed and weather-beaten
sign, one of the triumphs of a noted Milnrow foot-racer, on
Doncaster race-course. Milnrow is still famous for its foot-racers,
as Lancashire, generally, is more particularly famous for
foot-racers than any other county in the kingdom. In that
building the ancient lords of Rochdale manor used to hold
their court-leets. Now, the dry-throated "lads o' th' fowd"
meet there nightly, to grumble at bad warps and low wages;
and to "fettle th' nation," over pitchers of cold ale. And
now, if the traveller loves to climb "the slopes of old renown,"
and worships old heraldries and rusty suits of mail, let him go to
the other end of the village. I will go with him, if, like me,
while he venerates old chronicles, whether of stone, metal, or
parchment, because the spirit of the bygone sometimes streams
upon us through them, he still believes in the proverb, that
"every man is the son of his own works;" I will play the
finger-post to him with right good will. There is something at
the other end of Milnrow worth his notice.</p>

<p>Milnrow lies on the ground not unlike a tall tree laid lengthwise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
in a valley, by a river side. At the bridge, its roots spread
themselves in clots and fibrous shoots, in all directions; while
the almost branchless trunk runs up, with a little bend, above
half a mile, towards Oldham, where it again spreads itself out
in an umbrageous way, at the little fold called "Butterworth
Hall." In walking through the village, he who has seen a tolerably-built
wooden mill will find no wonders of the architectural
art at all. The houses are almost entirely inhabited by working
people, and marked by a certain rough, comfortable solidity&mdash;not
a bad reflex of the character of the inhabitants. At the
eastern extremity, a road leads on the left hand to the cluster
of houses called "Butterworth Hall." This old fold is worth
notice, both for what it is, and what it has been. It is a suggestive
spot. It is near the site once occupied by one of the
homesteads of the Byrons, barons of Rochdale, the last baron of
which family was Lord Byron, the poet. A gentleman in this
township, who is well acquainted with the history and archæology
of the whole county, lately met with a licence from the
Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, dated <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1400, granting
to Sir John Byron and his wife leave to have divine service
performed within their oratories at Clayton and Butterworth, in
the county of Lancashire. (Lane. MSS., vol. xxxii., p. 184.)
This was doubtless the old <i>wooden chapel</i> which traditionally
is said to have existed at Butterworth Hall, and which is still
pointed out by the names of two small fields, called "Chapel
Yard" and "Chapel Meadow." These names occur in deeds
at Pike House (the residence of the Halliwell family, about two
miles off), in the time of Queen Elizabeth, and are known to this
day. It is probable that the Byrons never lived at Butterworth
Hall after the Wars of the Roses. They quitted Clayton, as a
permanent residence, on acquiring Newstead, in the reign of
Henry the Eighth, although "young Sir John," as he was called,
lived at Royton Hall, near Oldham, another seat of the family,
between 1592 and 1608.</p>

<p>At Butterworth Hall, the little river Beal, flowing down fresh
from the heathery mountains, which throw their shadows upon
the valley where it runs, divides the fold; and upon a green plot,
close to the northern margin of its water, stands an old-fashioned
stone hall, hard by the site of the ancient residence of the Byrons.
After spending an hour at the other end of the village, with the
rugged and comfortable generation dwelling there, among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
memorials of "Tim Bobbin"&mdash;that quaint old schoolmaster, of
the last century&mdash;who was "the observed of all observers,"
there, in his day, and who will be remembered long after
some of the monumental brasses and sculptured effigies of his
contemporaries are passed by with, incurious eyes&mdash;one thinks
it will not be uninteresting, nor profitless, to come and muse a
little upon the spot where the Byrons once lived in feudal state.
But let not any contemplative visitor here lose his thoughts too
far among antiquarian dreams, and shadows of the past, for there
are factory-bells close by. However large the discourse of his
mind may be, let him never forget that there is a strong and
important present in the social life around him. And wherever
he sets his foot, in South Lancashire, he will now find that there
are shuttles flying where once was the council chamber of a
baron; and that the people of these days are drying warps in
the "shooting-butts" and tilt-yards of the olden time!</p>

<p>The following information respecting the Byron family, Barons
of Rochdale, copied from an article in the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>,
by the eminent antiquarian contributor to that journal, will not
be uninteresting to some people:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Byrons, of Clayton and Rochdale, Lancashire, and Newstead Abbey, Notts,
are descended from Ralph de Buron, who, at the time of the Conquest, and of the
Doomsday Survey, held divers manors in Notts and Derbyshire. Hugo de Buron,
grandson of Ralph, and feudal Baron of Horsetan, retiring <i>temp.</i> Henry III. from
secular affairs, professed himself a monk, and held the hermitage of Kirsale or Kersal,
under the priory of Lenton. His son was Sir Roger de Buron. Robert de Byron,
son of Sir Roger de Buron, in the John 1st [1199-1200], married Cecilia, daughter
and heiress of Richard Clayton, of Clayton, and thus obtained the manor and estates
of Clayton. Failsworth and the township of Droylsden were soon after added to
their Lancashire estates. Their son, Robert de Byron, lord of Clayton, was witness
to a grant of Plying Hay in this country, to the monks of Cockersand, for the souls
of Henry II. and Richard I. And his son, John de Byron, who was seated at
Clayton, 28th Edward I. [1299-30], was governor of York, and had all his lands in
Rochdale, with his wife Joan, by gift of her father, Sir Baldwin Teutonicus, or
Thies, or de Tyas, who was conservator of the peace in Lancashire, 10th Edward
[1281-82]. Her first husband was Sir Robert Holland, secretary of Thomas, Earl of
Lancaster. Their son was Sir John de Byron, knight, lord of Clayton, who was one
of the witnesses to the charter granted to the burgesses of Manchester, by Thomas
Grelle, lord of that manor, in 1301. The two first witnesses to that document were
"Sirs John Byron, Richard Byron, knights." These were father and son. Sir John
married Alice, cousin and heir of Robert Bonastre, of Hindley, in this county. Their
son, Sir Richard, lord of Cadenay and Clifton, had grant of free warren in his demesne
lands in Clayton, Butterworth, and Royton, on the 28th June, 1303; he
served in parliament for Lincolnshire, and died before 21st Edward III. [1347-8].
His son was Sir James de Byron, who died before 24th Edward III. [1350-51]. His
son and heir was Sir John de Byron, who was knighted by Edward III. at the siege
of Calais [1346-7], and dying without issue, was succeeded by his brother, Sir
Richard, before 4th Richard II. [1380-81]. Sir Richard died in 1398, and was succeeded
by his son, Sir John <i>le</i> Byron, who received knighthood before 3rd Henry V.
[1415-16], and as one of the knights of the shire, 7th Henry VI. [1428-9]. He married
Margery, daughter of John Booth, of Barton. His eldest son, Richard le Byron,
dying in his father's lifetime, and Richard's son, James, dying without issue, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
estate passed to Richard's brother, Sir Nicholas, of Clayton, who married Alice,
daughter of Sir John Boteler, of Beausey or Bewsey, near Warrington. Their son
and heir was Sir John, who was constable of Nottingham Castle, and Sheriff of
Lancaster, in 1441 and 1442. Sir John fought in the Battle of Bosworth Field, on
the side of Henry VII., and was knighted on the field. Dying without issue in
1488, he was succeeded by his brother (then 30), Sir Nicholas, Sheriff of Lancaster,
in 1459, who was made Knight of the Bath in 1501, and died in January, 1503-4.
This son and heir, Sir John Byron (the one named in the above document), was
steward of the manors of Manchester and Rochdale, and, on the dissolution of the
monasteries, he had a grant of the priory of Newstead, 28th May, 1540. From that
time the family made Newstead their principal seat, instead of Clayton. This will
explain, to some extent, the transfer of Clayton, in 1547, from this same Sir John
Byron to John Arderon or Arderne. Either this Sir John or his son, of the same
name, in the year 1560, inclosed 260 acres of land on Beurdsell Moor, near Rochdale.
His three eldest sons dying without issue (and we may just note that Kuerden preserves
a copy of claim, without date, of Nicholas, the eldest, to the serjeanty of the
king's free court of Rochdale, and to have the execution of all attachments and
distresses, and all other things which belong to the king's bailiff there), Sir John was
succeeded by his youngest son, Sir John, whom Baines states to have been knighted
in 1759&mdash;probably a transposition of the figures 1579. This Sir John, in the 39th
Elizabeth [1596-7], styles himself "Farmer of the Manor of Rochdale," and makes
an annual payment to the Crown, being a fee farm rent to the honour of Rochdale.
In the 1st Charles I. [1625-6], the manor of Rochdale passed from the Byrons; but in
1638 it was reconveyed to them; and, though confiscated during the commonwealth,
Richard, Lord Byron, held the manor in 1660. Sir John's eldest son, Sir Nicholas,
distinguished himself in the wars in the Low Countries, and at the battle of Edgehill
(23rd October, 1642). He was general of Cheshire and Shropshire. His younger
brother, Sir John, was made K.B. at the coronation of James I. and a baronet in
1603. Owing to the failure of the elder line, this Sir John became ancestor of the
Lords Byron. Sir Nicholas was succeeded by his son, Sir John, who was made
K.B. at the coronation of Charles I.; was appointed by that king Lieutenant of the
Tower, in 1642, contrary to the wish of parliament; commanded the body of reserve
at Edgehill; and was created Lord Byron of Rochdale, 24th October, 1643. In
consequence of his devotion to the royal cause (for he fought against Oliver Cromwell
at the battle of Preston, in August, 1648), his manor of Rochdale was sequestered,
and held for several years by Sir Thomas Alcock, who held courts there in 1654, two
years after Lord Byron's death. So great was his lordship's royalist zeal, that he
was one of the seven specially exempted from the clemency of the government in the
"Act of Oblivion," passed by parliament on the execution of Charles I. Dying at
Paris, in 1652, without issue, he was succeeded by his cousin, Richard (son of Sir
John, the baronet just mentioned), who became second Lord Byron, and died 4th
October, 1679, aged 74. He was succeeded by his eldest son, William, who died
13th November, 1695, and was succeeded by his fourth son, William, who died
August 8th, 1736, and was succeeded by a younger son, William, fifth Lord Byron,
born in November, 1722, killed William Chaworth, Esq., in a duel, in January, 1765,
and died 19th May, 1798. He was succeeded by his great nephew, George Gordon,
the poet, sixth Lord Byron, who was born 22nd January, 1788, and died at Missolonghi,
in April, 1824. In 1823, he sold Newstead Abbey to James Dearden, Esq.,
of Rochdale; and in the same year, he sold the manor and estate of Rochdale to the
same gentleman, by whose son and heir they are now possessed. The manorial
rights of Rochdale are reputed (says Baines) to extend over 32,000 statute acres of
land, with the privileges of court baron and court leet in all the townships of the
parish, including that portion of Saddleworth which lies within the parish of Rochdale;
but excepting such districts as Robert de Lacy gave to the abbots of Whalley,
with right to inclose the same.</p></blockquote>

<p>The article goes on to say that the manor of Rochdale was
anciently held by the Ellands of Elland, and the Savilles, and
that on the death of Sir Henry Saville, it appears to have
merged in the possession of the Duchy of Lancaster; and Queen
Elizabeth, in right of her duchy possessions, demised that manor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
to Sir John Byron, by letters patent, dated May 12th, 27th year
of her reign (1585), from Lady-day, 1585, to the end of thirty-one
years.</p>

<p>The eye having now satisfied itself with what was notable
in and about Milnrow, I took my way home, with a mind
more at liberty to reflect on what I had seen. The history
of Lancashire passed in review before me; especially its latest
history. I saw the country that was once thick with trees that
canopied herds of wild animals, and thinnest of people, now
bare of trees, and thickest of population; the land which was
of least account of any in the kingdom in the last century, now
most sought after; and those rude elements which were looked
upon as "the riddlings of creation," more productive of riches
than all the Sacramento's gold, and ministers to a spirit which is
destined to change the social aspect of Britain. I saw the spade
sinking in old hunting grounds, and old parks now trampled by
the fast-increasing press of new feet. The hard cold soil is now
made to grow food for man and beast. Masses of stone and flag
are shaken from their sleep in the beds of the hills, and dragged
forth to build mills and houses with. Streams which have frolicked
and sung in undisturbed limpidity thousands of years, are
dammed up, and made to wash and scour, and generate steam.
Fathoms below the feet of the traveller, the miner is painfully
worming his way in labyrinthine tunnels; and the earth is
belching coals at a thousand mouths. The region teems with
coal, stone, and water, and a people able to subdue them all to
their purposes. These elements quietly bide their time, century
after century, till the grand plot is ripe, and the mysterious signal
given. Anon, when a thoughtful barber sets certain wheels
spinning, and a contemplative lad takes a fine hint from his
mother's tea-kettle, these slumbering powers start into astonishing
activity, like an army of warriors roused to battle by the trumpet.
Cloth is woven for the world, and the world buys it, and wears
it. Commerce shoots up from a poor pedlar with his pack on a
mule, to a giant merchant, stepping from continent to continent,
over the ocean, to make his bargains. Railways are invented,
and the land is ribbed with iron, for iron messengers to run upon,
through mountains and over valleys, on business commissions;
the very lightning turns errand-boy. A great fusion of thought
and sentiment springs up, and Old England is in hysterics about
its ancient opinions. A new aristocracy rises from the prudent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
persevering working-people of the district, and threatens to push
the old one from its stool. What is to be the upshot of it all?
The senses are stunned by the din of toil, and the view obscured
by the dust of bargain-making. But, through an opening in the
clouds, hope's stars are shining still in the blue heaven that over-spans
us. Take heart, ye toiling millions! The spirits of your
heroic forefathers are watching to see what sort of England you
leave to your sons!</p>

  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/t.png" width="50" height="51" alt=""></img>
</div>
<p class="drop-capi1"><span class="smcap">There</span> is a quiet tract of country on the eastern border
of Lancashire, lying in a corner, formed by the junction
of the rivers Mersey and Irwell, and having but little
intercourse with those great towns of the county which
boil with the industry of these days, a few miles off, to the north
and eastward. It is the green selvedge of our toilful district, in
that direction; and the winding waters of the Mersey lace its
meadows, lengthwise, until that river joins the more soiled and
sullen Irwell, on the northern boundary of the parish. In all the
landscape there are no hills to break the view; and, considering
the extent of land, trees are but sparsely scattered over it. It is
singular, also, that the oak will not flourish in this particular
spot; although there are some fine specimens of the other trees
common to the English soil. But the country is generally fertile,
and prettily undulated in some places; and it is a pleasant scene
in hay-time, "when leaves are large and long," and the birds
are singing with full-throated gladness in the green shade, while
the dewy swathe is falling to the mower's stroke, in the sunlight
of a June morning. Looking eastward, across the Mersey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the park-like plains and rustling woods of Cheshire stretch away,
in unbroken beauty, as far as the eye can see. Indeed, the whole
of this secluded tract, upon the Lancashire side of the river,
may be naturally reckoned part of that fruitful Cheshire district
which has, not inappropriately, been called "the market-garden
of Manchester." The parish of Flixton occupies nearly the
whole of this border nook of Lancashire; and the scattered
hamlet of Urmston, in this parish, lays claim to the honour
of being the birthplace of our earliest and most popular native
humourist, the celebrated John Collier, better known by his self-chosen
name of "Tim Bobbin,"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">A lad whose fame did resound</span><br />
<span class="i0">Through every village and town around;</span><br />
<span class="i0">For fun, for frolic, and for whim.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>And, certainly, the hamlet of Urmston is a spot quite in
keeping with all we know of the general character, and all we
can imagine of the earliest training of a man who owed so much
to nature, and who described the manners of the country folk
of his day with such living truth, enriched with the quaint tinge
of a humorous genius, which was his, and his only. Fortune,
and his own liking, seem to have made him a constant dweller
in the country. He was, by fits, fond of social company, and
business led him into towns, occasionally; but whenever he
visited towns, he seems to have always turned again towards the
chimney-corner of his country home with an undying love,
which fairly glows in every allusion he makes to his dwelling-place
at the village of Milnrow, and even to the honest, uncouth
hinds, who were his neighbours there; and whose portraits he
has drawn for us, so inimitably, in his celebrated story of
"Tummus and Mary." He was "a fellow of infinite jest; of
most excellent fancy." May his soul rest "in the bosom of
good old Abraham!"</p>

<p>Here, then, in green Urmston, John Collier is said to have
been born; and the almost unrecorded days of his childhood were
passed here. Even now, the scattered dwellers of the place
are mostly employed in agriculture, and their language and customs
savour more of three centuries ago than those which we
are used to in manufacturing towns. From the cottage homes,
and old-fashioned farmhouses, which are dropped over the landscape,
like birds' nests, "each in its nook of leaves," generation
after generation has come forth to wander through the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
grass-grown byeways, and brambly old lanes; to weave the same
chequered web of simple joys and sorrows, and cares and toils;
and to lie down at last in the same old churchyard, where the
"rude forefathers of the hamlet" are sleeping together so quietly.
It is a country well worth visiting by any lover of nature, for its
own sake. Its natural features, however, are those common
to English rural scenery in districts where there are no great
elevations, nor anything like thick woodlands; and though such
scenery is always pleasing to my mind, it was not on account of
its natural charms, nor to see its ancient halls, with the interesting
associations of past generations playing about them; nor the ivied
porches of its picturesque farmhouses; nor to peep through the
flower-shaded lattices of its cottage nests; nor even to scrape acquaintance
with the old-fashioned people who live in them, that
I first wandered out to Flixton; though there is more than one
quaint soul down there that I would rather spend an hour
with than with any two fiddlers in the county. Particularly
"Owd Rondle," the market-gardener, who used to tell me the
richest country tales imaginable. He had a dog, which "wur
never quiet, but when it wur feightin." He was a man of cheerful
temper, and clear judgment, mingled with a warm undercurrent
of chuckling humour, which thawed away stiff manners
in an instant. The last time I saw him, a friend of his was complaining
of the gloom of the times, and saying that he thought
England's sun had set. "Set;" said Rondle, "not it! But iv
it wur set, we'd get a devilish good moon up! Dunnut be so
ready to mout yor fithers afore th' time comes. Noather me
nor England mun last for ever. But Owd Englan's yung yet,
for oather peace or war, though quietness is th' best, an' th'
chepest; if they'n let us be quiet, on a daycent fuuting. So,
keep yor heart up; for th' shell shall be brokken; an' th' chicken
shall come forth; an' it shall be a cock-chicken; an' a feighter,
with a single kom!" But "Rondle" was not always in this
humour. He could doff his cap and bells at will; and liked,
what he called, "sarviceable talk," when any really serious
matter was afoot. Yet, it was not to see curious "Old Rondle"
that I first went down to Flixton. The district is so far out
of the common "trod," as Lancashire people say, that I doubt
whether I should ever have rambled far in that direction if it had
not been for the oft-repeated assertion that Urmston, in Flixton,
was the birthplace of John Collier. And it was a desire to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the reputed place of his nativity, and to verify the fact, as far as
I could, on the spot&mdash;since the honour has been claimed by more
than one other place in Lancashire&mdash;that first led me out there.</p>

<p>In my next chapter, gentle reader, if thou art minded so far
to do me pleasure, we will ramble down that way together:
and, I doubt not, that in the course of our journey thou wilt
hear or see something or other which may haply repay thee for
the trouble of going so far out of thy way with me.</p>

<p>It was on a cold forenoon, early in the month of April, that I
set off to see Urmston, in Flixton. The sky was gloomy, and
the air chill; but the cold was bracing, and the time convenient,
so I went towards Oxford Road Station in a cheerful
temper. Stretford is the nearest point on the line, and I took
my ticket to that village. We left the huge manufactories, and
the miserable chimney tops of "Little Ireland," down by the
dirty Medlock; we ran over a web of dingy streets, swarming
with dingy people; we flitted by the end of Deansgate (the
Ratcliffe Highway of Manchester), and over the top of Knott
Mill, the site of the Roman Station,&mdash;now covered with warehouses
and other buildings connected with the Bridgewater
Trust; we left the black, stagnant canal, coiled in the hollow,
and stretching its dark length into the distance, like a slimy
snake. We cleared the cotton mills, and dyeworks, and chemical
manufactories of Cornbrook. Pomona Gardens, too, we left
behind, with the irregular carpentry of its great picture sticking
up raggedly in the dun air, like the charred relics of a burnt
woodyard. These all passed in swift panorama, and the train
stopped at Old Trafford, the site of the "Art Exhibition," just
closed. Three years ago the inhabitants did not dream that this
was to be the gathering-place of the grandest collection of works
of art the world ever saw, and the scene of more bustle and
pomp than was ever known on any spot in the north of England,
before. The building was up, but not opened, and as we went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
by we had a good view of the shapeless mass, and of many
curious people tooting about the enclosure to see what was going
on. Old Trafford takes its name from the Trafford family, or
rather, I believe, gives its name to that family, whose ancient
dwelling, Old Trafford Hall, stands in part of its once extensive
gardens, near the railway. Baines says of this family, "The
Traffords were settled here (at Trafford) at a period anterior to
the Norman conquest, and ancient documents in possession of
the family show that their property has descended to the present
representative, not only by an uninterrupted line of male heirs,
but without alienation, during the mutations in national faith,
and the violence in civil commotions. Henry, the great-grandson
of Ranulphus de Trafford, who resided at Trafford in the reign
of Canute and Edward the Confessor, received lands from Helias
de Pendlebury; in Chorlton, from Gospatrick de Chorlton; and
in Stretford, from Hamo, the third baron of that name, of Dunham
Massie; and from Pain of Ecborn (Ashburn) he had the
whole of the lordship of Stretford." The whole of Stretford
belongs to the Traffords still. "In the reign of Henry VI. Sir
Edmund Trafford, of Trafford, assisted at the coronation of the
king, and received the honour of Knight of the Bath on that
occasion." A certain poet says truly&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though much the centuries take, and much bestow,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Most through them all immutable remains;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>but the mind sets out upon a curious journey when it starts from
modern Manchester, with its industrialism and its political unions,
its hearty workers and its wealthy traders, its charities and its
poverties, its mechanics' institutions and its ignorance, its religions
and its sins, and travels through the successive growths of change
which have come over the life of man since the days of Canute
(when Manchester must have been a rude little woodland town),
speculating as it goes as to what is virtually changed, and what
remains the same through the long lapse of time, linking the
"then" and "there," with "now" and "here." But we are
now fairly in the country, and the early grass is peeping out of
the ground, making all the landscape look sweetly green. In a
few minutes the whole distance had been run, and I heard the
cry, "Out here for Stretford!" Leaving the station, I went to
the top of the railway bridge, which carries the high road over
the line. From that elevation I looked about me. It commands
a good view of the village hard by, and of the country for miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
around. This great tract of meadows, gardens, and pasture land,
was once a thick woodland, famous, in the Withington district,
for its fine oak trees. In Flixton the oak was never found, except
of stunted growth. A few miles to westward, the parks of
Dunham and Tatton show how grand the old growth of native
trees must have been on the Cheshire border; and in the north-east,
the woods of Trafford make a dark shadow on the scene.
And here at hand is the old village of Stretford, the property
of the Traffords of Trafford; whose arms give name to the
principal inn of the village, as well as to one or two others on
the road from Manchester. The man in motley, with a flail in
his hand, and the mottos, "Now, thus;" "Gripe Griffin; hold
fast!" greet the traveller with a kind of grim historic salutation
as he goes by. These are household phrases with the inhabitants,
many of whom are descendants of the ancient tenantry of the
family. Quiet Stretford! close to the Cheshire border; the
first rural village after leaving that great machine-shop called
Manchester. Depart from that city in almost any other direction,
and you come upon a quick succession of the same manufacturing
features you have left behind, divided, of course, by
many a beautiful nook of country green. But somehow, though
a man may feel proud of these industrial triumphs, yet, if he has
a natural love of the country, he breathes all the more freely
when he comes out in this direction, from the knowledge that
he is entering upon a country of unmixed rural quietness and
beauty, and that the tremendous bustle of manufacture is entirely
behind him for the time. Stretford is an agricultural village, but
there is a kind of manufacture which it excels in. Ormskirk
is famous for its gingerbread; Bury for its "simblins," or
"simnels;" Eccles for those spicy cakes, which "Owd Chum"&mdash;the
delight of every country fair in these parts&mdash;used to sell at
the "Rushbearings" of Lancashire; but the mission of Stretford
is black puddings. And, certainly, a Stretford black pudding
would not be despised even by a famishing Israelite, if he happened
to value a dinner more than the ancient faith of his fathers.
Fruit, flowers, green market-stuff, black puddings, and swine's
flesh in general&mdash;these are the pride of the village. Roast pork,
stuffed in a certain savoury way, is a favourite dish here. The
village folks call it the "Stretford Goose;" and it is not a bad
substitute for that pleasant bird, as I found. Stretford is nearly
all in one street, by the side of the highway going into Cheshire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
It has grown very much in late years, but enow of its old features
remain to give the place a quaint tone, and to show what it was
fifty years ago, before Manchester merchants began to build mansions
in the neighbourhood, and Manchester tradesmen began to
go out there to lodge. There was once an old church in Stretford,
of very simple architecture, built and endowed by the Trafford
family. Nothing of it now remains but the graveyard, which
is carefully enclosed. I looked through the rails into this weedy
sanctuary of human decay. It had a still, neglected look. "The
poor inhabitants below" had been gathering together there a
long while, and their memories now floating down the stream of
time, far away from the sympathies of the living, except in that
honourable reverence for the dead, which had here enclosed
their dust from unfeeling intrusion. It was useless for me to
wonder who they were that lay there; how long they had been
mouldering in company, or what manner of life they had led.
Their simple annals had faded, or were fading away. The wind
was playing with the grave-grass; the village life of Stretford
was going on as blithe as ever round this quiet enclosure, and I
walked forward. Even such is time&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who in the dark and silent grave,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When we have wandered all our ways,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Shuts up the story of our days.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>The "curfew" has "tolled the knell of parting day" over the
woods and fields around this village ever since the time of William
the Conqueror. I had agreed to call upon a friend of mine here
before going down to Flixton, so I walked a little way farther
down the village, and then turning through a certain orchard,
as directed, I came into a green lane beyond. There stood the
house, on the opposite side of the lane, at the top of a gentle
slope of garden, shaded with evergreens, among which rose up
one remarkably fine variegated holly. The hedgerows were
trim, and the cottage on the knoll, with its bright windows
"winking through their screen of leaves," looked very sweet,
still, and nest-like. And then the little garden&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A garden faire, and in the corner set</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ane harbour grene, with wandis long and small</span><br />
<span class="i0">Railit about, and so with treis set</span><br />

<span class="i0">That lyf was non walking there forbye,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That might within scarce ony wight aspye.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>I stood still a minute, for the place was pleasant to look upon,
and then opening the gate, and starting the birds from every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
bush, went up through the little garden. I met with a hearty
welcome, and mine host and myself soon had the snug tree-shaded
parlour to ourselves. I was at home in a minute; but, as we
chatted about the books on the shelves and the pictures on the
walls, there came from somewhere in the house an aroma that
"made my teeth shoot water." I was talking of books, but in
my mind I was wondering what it was that sent forth such a
goodly smell; for I was hungry. My friend either divined my
thoughts, or else he was secretly affected in the same way, for
he said, "We are going to have a 'Stretford Goose' to-day."
Now, I was curious, and the smell was fine, and my appetite
keen, and I was fain when the goose and its trimmings came in.
When we fell to, I certainly was the hero of the attack, and the
goose came down before our combined forces like a waste-warehouse
in flames. It was a wholesome, bountiful English meal,
"wi' no fancy wark abeawt it;" and since that April noontide
I have always felt an inward respect for a "Stretford Goose."</p>

<p>When dinner was fairly over, I lost no time in starting for
Flixton, which was only three miles off; with what some people
call "a good road" to it. And it certainly is better than those
terrible old roads of North Lancashire, of which Arthur Young
writes with such graphic ferocity. "Reader," says he, "did'st
thou ever go from Wigan to Preston? If not; don't. Go to
the devil rather; for nothing can be so infernal as that road is."
The hedges by the wayside were covered with little buds. The
murky clouds had left the sky, and the day was fine. There
was a wintry nip in the air, which was pleasant enough to me;
but it gave the young grass and the thorn-buds a shrinking look,
as if they had come out too soon to be comfortable. The ground
was soft under foot, and I had to pick my way through the
"slutch" now and then. There had been long and heavy rains,
and I could see gleaming sheets of water left on the low-lying
meadow lands on the Cheshire side of the river. But I was in
no humour for grumbling, for the country was new to me, and
I looked around with pleasure, though the land was rather bare
and shrivelled,&mdash;like a fowl in the moult,&mdash;for it had hardly got
rid of winter's bleakness, and had not fairly donned the new suit
of spring green. But the birds seemed satisfied, for they chirruped
blythely among the wind-beaten thorns, and hopped and played
from bough to bough in the scant-leaved trees. If these feathered
tremblers had weathered the hard winter, by the kindness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Providence, and amidst this lingering chill, could hail the drawing
near of spring with such glad content, why should I repine? By
the way, that phrase, "the drawing near of spring," reminds me
of the burden of an ancient May song, peculiar to the people of
this district. In the villages hereabouts, they have an old custom
of singing in the month of May; and companies of musicians
and "May-singers" go from house to house among their neighbours,
on April nights, to sing under their chamber windows
this old song about "the drawing near unto the merry month of
May." An old man, known in Stretford as a "May-singer," an
"herb-gatherer," and a "Yule-singer," who gets a scanty living
out of the customs of each season of the year as it comes, furnished
me with a rough copy of the words and music of this old "May
Song." In one verse of the song, each member of the sleeping
family is addressed by name in succession,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then rise up, Sarah Brundrit, all in your gown of green;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>and as each appears at the window, they are saluted with a
"Merry May." Since the time of my visit I have been enabled,
through the kindness of John Harland, Esq., F.S.A., to give
this old May song, in complete shape, as it appears in his first
volume of "Lancashire Ballads," recently published by Mr.
Edwin Slater, of Manchester:&mdash;</p>

<p>About a mile on the road, I came to a green dingle, called
"Gamershaw." A large brick dwelling-house now occupies
the spot; which was formerly shaded by spreading trees,&mdash;a
flaysome nook, of which the country folk were afraid at
night-time, as the haunt of a goblin, called "Gamershaw
Boggart." Every rustle of the trees at Gamershaw was big
with terror to them half a century ago. Even now, when
"Gamershaw Boggart" has hardly a leaf to shelter its old
haunt, the place is fearful after dark, to the superstitious
people of Flixton parish. And yet there seems to be some
change working in this respect, for when I asked a villager
whether "Gamershaw Boggart" was ever seen now, he said,
"Naw; we never see'n no boggarts neaw; nobbut when th'
brade-fleigh's (bread-rack) empty!"</p>

<p>Leaving "Gamershaw," I "sceawrt eendway," as Collier says.
Here I had the advantage of an intelligent companion, with a
rich store of local anecdote in him. He was not a man inclined
to superstition: but he said he once had an adventure at this
spot, which startled him. Walking by "Gamershaw," on a
pitch-dark night, and thinking of anything but boggarts, he
heard something in the black gloom behind, following his
footsteps with a soft, unearthly trot, accompanied by an unmistakable
rattle of chains. He stopt. It stopt. He went
on; and the fearful sounds dogged him again, with malignant
regularity. "Gamershaw Boggart, after all, and no mistake,"
thought he: and in spite of all reason, a cold sweat began to come
over him. Just then the goblin made a fiendish dash by, and went
helter-skelter down the middle of the road, trailing the horrible
clang of chains behind it, with infernal glee; and then dived
into the midnight beyond. To his relief, however, he bethought
him that it was a large dog belonging to a farmer in the neighbourhood.
The dog had got loose, and was thus making night
hideous by unconsciously personifying "Gamershaw Boggart."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>And now my companion and I whiled away the time from
Gamershaw with a pleasant interchange of country anecdote. I
have just room for one, which I remember hearing in some of
my rambles among the moorland folk of my native district. It
is a story of a poor hand-loom weaver, called "Thrum," trying
to sell his dog "Snap" to a moorland farmer. I have put it in
the form of a dialogue, that it may be the more understandable
to the general reader. It runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Thrum.</i> Maister, dun yo want a nice bull-an-tarrier?</p>

<p><i>Farmer.</i> A what?</p>

<p><i>Thrum.</i> A bull-an-tarrier dog, wi' feet as white as snow!
Brass wouldn't ha' parted me an' that dog, iv there hadn't bin
sich ill deed for weyvers just neaw,&mdash;it wouldn't, for sure.
For aw'd taen to th' dog, an' the dog had taen to me, very mich,
for o' at it had nobbut thin pikein' sometimes. But poverty
parts good friends neaw and then, maister.</p>

<p><i>Farmer.</i> A bull-an-tarrier, saysto?</p>

<p><i>Thrum.</i> Ay; an' th' smartest o'th breed at ever ran at a
mon's heels! It's brother to that dog o' Lolloper's, at stoole a
shoolder o' mutton, an' ran up a soof with it.</p>

<p><i>Farmer.</i> Ay; is it one o' that family?</p>

<p><i>Thrum.</i> It is for sure. They're prime steylers, o' on em.</p>

<p><i>Farmer.</i> Has it a nick under its nose?</p>

<p><i>Thrum.</i> A nick,&mdash;naw it hasn't.... Houd; what mak
ov a nick dun yo meeon?</p>

<p><i>Farmer.</i> Has it a meawth?</p>

<p><i>Thrum.</i> Ay; it's a grand meawth; an' a rook o'th prattiest
teeth at ever wur pegged into a pair o' choles! A sharper,
seawnder set o' dog-teeth never snapt at a ratton! Then, look
at it e'en; they're as breet as th' north star, ov a frosty neet!
An' feel at it nose; it's as cowd as iccles! That dog's some
sarviceable yelth (health) abeawt it, maister.</p>

<p><i>Farmer.</i> Aw'll tell tho what,&mdash;it looks hungry.</p>

<p><i>Thrum.</i> Hungry! It's olez hungry! An' it'll heyt aught
i'th world, fro a collop to a dur latch.... Oh, ay; it's reet
enough for that.</p>

<p><i>Farmer.</i> Well, owd mon; aw've nought again thi dog, but
that nick under it nose. To tell tho th' treawth, we may'n
meawths here faster nor we may'n mheyt. Look at yon woman!
Aw would e'en ha' tho to tay thi dog wheer they're noan as
thick upo th' clod as here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Thrum.</i> Oh, aw see.... Well, eawr Matty's just the
very same; nobbut her nose has rayther a sharper poynt to't
nor yor wife's.... Yo see'n aw thought it wur time to sell
th' dog, when aw had to ax owd Thunge to lend mo a bite ov
his moufin whol aw'd deawn't my piece. But aw'll go fur on.
So good day to yo.... Come, Snap, owd lad; aw'll find
thee a good shop, or else aw'll sweat.</p>

<p>Chatting about such things as these, we came up to a plain
whitewashed hall-house, standing a little off the road, called
"Newcroft." This was pointed out to me as the residence of a
gentleman related to the famous "Whitworth doctors." The
place looked neat and homely, and had orderly grounds and
gardens about, but there was nothing remarkable in its general
appearance which would have stopt me, but for the interesting
fact just mentioned. It brought to my mind many a racy story
connected with that worthy old family of country doctors, and
their quaint independent way of life in the little moorland village
of Whitworth, near "Fairies Chapel," the scene of one of those
"Lancashire Traditions" which Mr. John Roby wrote about.
I found afterwards that this "Newcroft" was, in old time, the
homestead of the great Cheshire family of Warburton, of which
family R. E. E. Warburton, Esq., of Arley Hall, is the present
representative. I understand that the foundations of the old hall
are incorporated with the present building. There are very few
trees about the place now; and these afford neither shade to the
house nor much ornament to the scene. The name of Warburton
is still common about here, both among the living, and on the
gravestones of Flixton churchyard. The saying, "Aw'll tear tho
limb fro Warbu'ton," is common all over Lancashire as well as
Cheshire. One side of its meaning is evident enough, but its
allusions used to puzzle me. I find that it has its origin in the
curiously-involved relations of the two Cheshire rectories of
Lymm and Warburton, and in some futile effort which was once
made to separate them. Written this way, "I'll tear tho limb
(Lymm) fro Warbu'ton (Warburton)," the saying explains itself
better. There is a ballad in Dr. Latham's work on "The
English Language," in which the present "Squire ov Arley Ha'"
is mentioned in a characteristic way. It is given in that work
as a specimen of the Cheshire dialect. It certainly is the raciest
modern ballad of its kind that I know of. The breeze of nature
has played in the heart of the writer, whoever he be. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
allusions and language have so much affinity with the Lancashire
side of the water, that I think the reader will forgive me for
introducing it, that he may judge of it for himself. The title is
"Farmer Dobbin; or, a Day wi' the Cheshire Fox Dogs."
Here it is; and I fancy that a man with any blood in his body

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<div class="poetrycenter">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In sunshine and in shade, in wet and fair,</div>
<div class="verse">Drooping or blithe of heart, as might befall:</div>
<div class="verse">My best companions now the driving winds,</div>
<div class="verse">And now the "trotting brooks" and whispering trees,</div>

<p class="pa">&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Wordsworth.</span></p>

<p>A short walk from "Newcroft" brought me to a dip in the
highway, at a spot where four roads meet in the hollow, a
"four-lone-eends," as country folk call it. Such places had an
awful interest for the simple hinds of Lancashire in old times;
and, in remote parts of the county, the same feeling is strong
yet with regard to them. In ancient days, robbers, and other
malefactors, were sometimes buried at the ends of four cross
roads, unhallowed by "bell, book, or candle." The old superstitions
of the people, cherished by their manner of life, dwelling,
as they did, in little seclusions, scattered over the country around,
made these the meeting-places of witches, and all sorts of unholy
things, of a weird nature. It is a common belief now, among
the natives of the hills and solitary cloughs of Lancashire, that
the best way of laying a ghost, or quieting any unearthly spirit
whose restlessness troubles their lonely lives, is to sacrifice a cock
to the goblin, and, with certain curious ceremonies, to bury the
same deep in the earth at a "four-lone-eends," firmly pinned
to the ground by a hedge-stake, driven through its body. The
coldly-learned, "lost in a gloom of uninspired research," may
sneer at these rustic superstitions; yet, surely, he was wiser
who said that he would rather decline to the "traditionary sympathies
of unlettered ignorance," than constantly see and hear</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The repetitions wearisome of sense,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where soul is dead, and feeling hath no place;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where knowledge, ill begun in cold remark</span><br />
<span class="i0">On outward things, in formal inference ends</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>Near this place stands the handsome mansion of J. T. Hibbert,
Esq., the president of the Mutual Improvement Society at Stretford,
and a general benefactor to the neighbourhood in which he
resides. He seems to have awakened that locality to the spirit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
modern improvement, and is making what was, comparatively,
a desert nook before, now gradually smile around him. The
people thereabouts say that "it wur quite a lost place afore he
coom." We are now in the township of Urmston, though not
in the exact spot where "Tim Bobbin" was born. As I stood
in the hollow, looking round at the little cluster of dwellings, my
friend pointed to a large, sleepy-looking old brick house, with a
slip of greensward peeping through the paling in front, as the
dwelling of William Shore, Esq., an eminent local musician, the
author of that beautiful glee-arrangement of the music to Burns's
matchless carousal song, "Willie brewed a peck o' maut," so
much admired by all lovers of the concord of sweet sounds.
And, certainly, if the musician had never done anything more
than that exquisite gem of harmony, it would have added an
interest to his dwelling-place. Who, that loved music, could go
by such a spot without noticing it? Not I; for, as Wordsworth
says of the pedlar who sometimes accompanied him in his mountain
rambles, so, partly, may I say&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">Not a hamlet could we pass,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Rarely a house, that did not yield to him</span><br />
<span class="i0">Remembrances.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>And yet I have a misgiving that the reader thinks I am lingering
too tediously on the way; but, really, wherever one goes in
England, apart from the natural beauty of the country, he finds
the ground rich as "three-pile velvet" in all sorts of interesting
things. It is a curiously-illuminated miscellany of the finest
kind; and, in spite of all it has gone through, thank Heaven, it
is neither moth-eaten nor mildewed, nor in any way weakened
by age. Its history is written all over the land in rich memorials,
with a picturesque freshness which he that runs may read,
if he only have feeling and thought to accompany him about the
island, as he wades through the harvest of its historic annals,
strewn with flowers of old romance, and tale, and hoary legend,
and dewy with gems of native song.</p>

<p>Quitting the hamlet, we passed a mansion, half hidden by a
brick wall, and thinly shaded by trees; a few straggling cottages;
a neat little village school came next; one or two substantial
English granges, surrounded by large outhouses, and clean, spacious
yards, with glittering windows adorned with flowers, and
a general air of comfort and repose about them; and then the
hamlet dribbled away with a few more cottages, and we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
in the open country, upon the high level land; from whence we
could look westward over the fields, below which "the Cheshire
waters,"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">To their resting-place serene,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Came fresh'ning and refreshing all the scene.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>In the recently published "History of Preston and its Environs,"
by Mr. Charles Hardwick, the author of that admirable
volume enters into an ingenious dissertation upon the derivation
of the name of this river, and after suggesting that its name may
be derived from "mere" and "sea," or sea-lake, says, "South of
Manchester, at this day, the river is not known by many of the
peasantry as the Mersey. It is called by them the 'Cheshire
Waters.' The modern name appears to have been derived from
the estuary, and not from the fresh-water stream." Mr. Hardwick's
remark is equally true of the people dwelling here by that
river, on the eastern side of Manchester. A few fields divide the
high road from the water, and then slope down to its margin.
From the road we could see the low, fertile expanse of Cheshire
meadows and woods spread away to the edge of the horizon in
one beautiful green level. When the river was swollen by long
rains, the nearer part of the Cheshire side used to present the
appearance of a great lake, before the embankment was thrown
up to protect the fields from inundation. In past times, that
rich tract must have been a vast marsh. But yonder stands
Urmston Hall, upon a green bank, overlooking the river. As I
drew nearer the building, I was more and more struck with its
picturesque appearance, as seen from the high road, which goes
by it, at about a hundred yards' distance. It is a fine specimen
of the wood-and-plaster hall, once common in Lancashire, of
which Hulme Hall was an older, and perhaps the richest example,
so near Manchester. Urmston Hall is "of the age of Elizabeth,
adorned by a gable, painted in lozenges and trefoils." Baines
says, "According to Seacombe, Sir Thomas Lathom possessed
the manor of Urmston, in this parish (Flixton), and at his death,
I Edward III., he settled upon his natural son, Sir Oscatel, and
his heirs, the manors of Irlam and Urmston, about the time when
the Stanleys, whose heir had married Lady Elizabeth Lathom,
assumed the crest of the Eagle and Child." He says further,
"That according to other and higher authorities, the lands and
lordship of Urmston have been the property of the Urmstons
and Hydes in succession, from the time of King John to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
seventeenth century; and that the Urmstons resided at Urmston
Hall until they removed to Westleigh, and were succeeded by the
Hydes." The spacious carriage road still preserves its old proportion,
though now rutted by the farmers' carts belonging to the
present occupants of the place. A few tall relics of the fine trees
which once surrounded the hall are still standing about, like faithful
domestics clinging to the fallen fortunes of an ancient master.</p>

<p>And now, I begin to think of the special errand which has
brought me to the place. There stands the old hall; and yonder
is a row of four or five raw-looking, new brick cottages, such as
one sees spring up at the edges of great factory towns, by whole
streets at once, almost in a night&mdash;like Jonah's gourd. They hold
nothing&mdash;they cost nothing&mdash;they are made out of nothing&mdash;they
look nothing&mdash;and they come to nothing&mdash;as a satirical
friend of mine says, who is satisfied with nothing. If it were
not that one knows how very indifferently the common people
were housed in those old days when the hall was in its glory, it
really is enough to make one dissatisfied with the whole thing.
With the exception of the hall and these cottages, the green
country spreads out all around for some distance. When we
came up to the row, my friend said that the endmost house
stood on the spot, three years ago occupied by the old wood-and-plaster
building in which "Tim Bobbin" was born, and in
which his father, John Collier the elder, taught the children of
Flixton parish, gathered from the rural folds in the distance.
The house was gone, but, nevertheless, I must make what research
I could, and to that end I referred to my note-book, and
found that Baines says: "In a small house, opposite (Urmston
Hall), bearing the name of 'Richard o' Jone's, was born John
Collier, the renowned 'Tim Bobbin,' the provincial satirist of
Lancashire, as appears from the following document:&mdash;'Baptisms
in the parish church of Flixton in the year 1709&mdash;John, son of
Mr. John Collier, of Urmston, baptised January the 8th.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>&mdash;I
hereby certify this to be a true extract of the parish register book
at Flixton, as witness my hand, this 30th November, 1824.&mdash;(Signed)
<span class="smcap">Thomas Harper</span>, parish clerk.'" This was all clear
and straightforward so far as it went, but I wanted to prove the
thing for myself, as far as possible, on the spot. I thought it best
to begin by inquiring at the nearest of these cottages, opposite
Urmston Hall. Inside I heard the dismal rattle of hand-looms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
at work, and through the window I could see the web and
the wooden beams of the machine, and a pale gingham weaver,
swaying back and forward as he threw his shuttle to and fro.
The door, which led into the other part of the cottage, was
open, and a middle-aged woman, with a thin, patient face, was
spinning there, on the wooden wheel still used in country places.
This was the first indication I had noticed of any part of the
population being employed in manufacture. I went to the open
door, and asked the woman if this was not the spot where
"Tim Bobbin" was born, expecting a ready and enthusiastic
affirmative. She gazed at me for an instant, with a kind of
vague curiosity; and, to my astonishment, said she really couldn't
tell. She hardly seemed to know who "Tim Bobbin" was.
Poor as the inmates were, everything inside spoke of industry
and cleanliness, and simple, honest living. She called her husband
from his looms, in the other part of the cottage; but his
answer was nearly the same, except that he referred me to a
person in the neighbourhood, who was formerly master of the
school kept in this old house, called "Richard o' Jone's." I
turned and left the spot with a feeling of disappointment, but
with a stronger desire to know whether anything was known
about the matter among the inhabitants of the locality. To this
end, I and my friend rambled on towards Flixton, inquiring of
high and low, and still nobody knew anything definite about it,
though there was a general impression among them that he was
born at the old cottage formerly standing opposite Urmston Hall;
but they perpetually finished by referring to "Jockey Johnson,"
"Owd Cottrill, th' pavor," "Owd White-yed, th' saxton," and
the parish schoolmaster before-mentioned. The parish clerk, too,
might know something, they said. And here, as we wandered
about in this way, a tall gentleman, a little past the middle age,
dressed in black, came quietly up the road. My friend, to whom
he was known, at once introduced me to the Rev. Mr. Gregory,
the incumbent of Flixton, and told him my errand. The incumbent
kindly invited me to look through the parish register, at
his house, the first convenient afternoon I had to spare; which
I did very soon after. Setting aside "Jockey Johnson," and
"Owd Cottrill, th' pavor," and the other authorities of the
hamlet so oft referred to, till a better opportunity, I thought
that the schoolmaster, being a native man, and having lived long
in the very house where "Tim" is said to have been born,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
would probably feel some pride in his celebrated predecessor,
and, perhaps, be a willing conservator of any tradition existing
in the hamlet respecting him. His house was a little more than
a mile off; and I started along the high road back to a point from
whence an old lane leads out, eastward, to the schoolmaster's
solitary cottage in the distant fields.</p>

<div class="verse">In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts</div>
<div class="verse">Bring sad thoughts to the mind.</div>
</div></div></div>
<p class="pa"><span class="smcap">Wordsworth.</span></p>

<p>Leaving the high-road at the place I had been told of, I went
up an old lane, which soon led between a little fold of cottages.
The first of these were old rude buildings of stone, with the
roofs fallen in, and seemingly abandoned to decay. The others
were of more modern appearance, and partly tenanted by hand-loom
weavers. Through the open doors of one or two I saw
that cheerful twinkle of humble comfort, which is, perhaps,
more delightful to meet with in such lowly nooks than in
prouder quarters; because it shows how much happiness may be
drawn out of little means, by wholesome minds. If the doors had
been closed, I could have guessed at the condition of the interior
by the clean door-step and windows, and by the healthy pot-flowers
peeping prettily through the panes. Folk who can make
such places beautiful by simple cleanliness and native taste, are the
unlettered gentry of nature, more blest in their low estate than
they can understand, when they compare it with the glitter of
the fuming world in the distance. Like the lark's nest, though
near the ground, their homes are neat and sweet, out of humble
materials, and blithe with the neighbourhood of nature. Some
of these cottages were of duller aspect, though there was nothing
of that dirty sickliness about them which is so common in the
back quarters of city life. But I have noticed that, even in the
lowest parts of great towns, now and then there comes a cottage
all cleanliness and order, a sweet little household oasis amidst the
wilderness of filth around; shining in the gloom, "like a good
deed in a naughty world."</p>

<p>When I came to the end of the fold, I found that the lane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
went forward in two directions; one right into the open green
country, where I could see no dwellings at hand, the other
winding back towards the village which I had left behind me,
at the high-road side. An old woman was looking from the
cottage door at the corner, and I asked her the way to the
schoolmaster's house. Country folk are not always known in
Lancashire by their real name, even on their own ground, and
she had to consult somebody inside about the matter. In a
minute or so, a voice from the cottage called out, "Does he
belung to th' owd body, thinken yo?"&mdash;meaning the old body
of Wesleyan Methodists. I said that I thought he did. "Oh,
ay," replied the voice, "it'll be William, sure enough....
Yo mun go reet forrud up th' lone afore yo, till yo come'n to a
heawse i'th fields,&mdash;an' that'll be it. It stons a bit off th' lone-side....
Yo'n ha' to pike yor gate, mind yo; for its nobbut
a mak o' durty under-fuut." On I went, between the hedge-rows,
slipping and stepping from pool to pool, down the miry
cow-lane, for nearly half a mile, slutching myself up to the collar
as I went; and there, about a stone's throw from the way-side, I
saw the schoolmaster's low-built cottage standing in a bit of
sweet garden in the middle of the wide green fields. Entering by
a tiny wooden gate at the back, I went along a narrow garden
walk, between little piles of rockery, and rows of shells, which
ornamented the beds, till I came winding up to the door in front;
which was shaded, if I remember right, by some kind of simple
trellis-work. The wind was now still&mdash;everything was still, but
the cheerful birds fluttering about, and filling the evening silence
with their little melodies. The garden and the cottage looked
sweet, and sleepily-beautiful. The windows blazed in the sunset,
which was flooding all the level landscape with its departing
splendour. I heard no stir inside, but knocking at the door, it
was opened by a quiet middle-aged man, who asked me in. This
was the schoolmaster himself; and, by the fireside sat a taller,
older man; who was his brother. The only other inmate was a
staid, elderly woman; whose dress, and mild countenance, was in
perfect keeping with the order and peace of everything around.
It was quite a sample of a quaint, comfortable English cottage
interior. As I glanced about, I could fancy that many of the
clean, little nick-nacks which I saw so carefully arranged, were
the treasured heirlooms of old country housekeepers. Everything
was in its right place, and cleaned up to its height. The house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
was as serene, and the demeanour of the people as seemly and
subdued as if it had been a little chapel; and the setting sun
streaming through the front window, filled the cottage with a
melting glory, which no magnificence of wealth could imitate.
Catching, unconsciously, the spirit of the hour, my voice crept
down nearer to the delicate stillness of the scene; and I whispered
my questions to the two brothers, as if to speak at all was a
desecration of that contemplative silence which seemed to steep
everything around, like a delicious slumber, filled with holy dreams.
We gradually got into conversation, and in the course of our talk
I gathered from the two brothers that they had lived and kept
school in the house where Baines says that Tim Bobbin was
born. They said that, though there was a general belief that he
was born in that house, yet they did not themselves possess anything
which clearly proved the fact. And yet it might be quite
true, they said; for they had often known artists come out there
to sketch the building as his birthplace. There were other people
in the parish who, they thought, might perhaps know more about
the matter. They said that there were many curious Latin mottoes
and armorial bearings painted on the walls and other parts of
the school-house, which many people attributed to Tim Bobbin&mdash;but
they were not quite sure that people were right in doing so.
I agreed with the two brothers in this. There is little doubt
that Tim was a fair Latin scholar in after life; I myself once
possessed a pocket copy of Terence's "Comedies," which had
undoubtedly belonged to him; and in the margin of which he
had corrected the Latinity. But according to what is known of
Tim's life elsewhere, he must have left the place of his birth
very early in youth, probably with some migration of his father's
family long before he could be able to deal with such matters.
The brothers did not know whether these relics had been preserved
or not when the house was taken down&mdash;they thought
not. The house had been occupied by them and their fathers,
as schoolmasters, for more than a hundred years gone by;
but they really could not tell much more about the matter.
They thought, however, that owd Tummus so and so would
be likely to know something about it&mdash;or owd Hannah Wood.
They were "two o'th owd'st folk i' Urmston; and that wur
sayin' summat." Was I in the reporting line they wondered....
Well, it was no matter&mdash;but Owd Tummus lived
about half a mile off; "o'er anent Cis Lone;" and I should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
sure to find him in. Thanking them for the information they
had given me, I left the quiet trio in their quiet cottage, and
came away. The evening was cold and clear, and the scattered
birds were twittering out the last notes of their vespers in secluded
solos, about the hedges. In the far east, the glimmering landscape
was melting away; but the glory which hovered on the
skirts of the sunken sun dazzled my eyes as I came down the old
lane in the gloaming; and I was happy in my lonely walk, come
of it whatever might.</p>

<p>I came up to the old man's house, just as the evening candles
were beginning to twinkle through cottage windows by the
way. He sat by the fire; a little man, thin and bent, but with a
face that spoke an old age that was "frosty, but kindly." There
were young people in the house; seemingly belonging to the farm.
After some preliminary chat about weather and the like, I drew
him in the direction of the subject I had come about; asking
whether he had ever heard that Tim Bobbin was born in Urmston.
He replied, "Well; aw have yerd it said so, aw think&mdash;but
my memory houds nought neaw.... Tim Bobbin, say'n
yo? Aw like as aw could mind summat abeawt that,&mdash;aw <i>do</i>....
Owd Back'll know; if onybody does, he <i>will</i>....
He's a goodish age, is th' owd lad,&mdash;he <i>is</i>; an' fause with it,&mdash;<i>very</i>....
Tim Bobbin! Tim Bobbin!... Aw'st be
eighty-three come th' time o'th year. Owd Back's a quarter
younger.... Aw've a pain taks me across here, neaw and
then. We're made o' stuff at winnut last for ever.... Ay,
ay; we'n sin summat i' eawr time, has Owd Back an me,&mdash;we

towd yo a tale, an' bowdly too,&mdash;aw could. But th' gam's up.
The dule's getten th' porritch, an th' Lord's getten th' pon to
scrape,&mdash;as usal." I was inquiring further about his friend
"Owd Back," when he stopped me by saying, "Oh, there's
Owd Hannah Wood; aw'd like to forgetten hur. Eh, that aw
should forget Owd Hannah! Hoo lives by the hee-gate, as yo
gwon to Stretford,&mdash;hoo <i>does</i>. What, are yo after property, or

set;&mdash;aw'st be amoon 'em in a bit. Well, well; neighbour
fare's no ill fare, as th' sayin' is." In this way the old man
wandered on till I rose to go; when, turning to the old woman
sitting near, he said, "Aw've just unbethought mo. William&mdash;&mdash;
will be the very mon to ax abeawt this Tim Bobbin; an' so will
their Sam. They liv't i'th heawse 'at he's speykin' on; an' so
did their on-setters (ancestors) afore 'em. Beside they're a mak
o' larnt folk. They're schoo maisters; an' so then." The old
man did not know that these were the men I had just left. After
resting a few minutes, he raised his head again, just before I came
away, to tell me, as others had done, that "Jockey Johnson," an'
"Cottril, th' pavor," were likely folk to sper on." In this way I
wandered to and fro; meeting, in most cases, with little more
than a glimmering remembrance of the thing, the dimness of
which, seeing that few seemed to take any strong interest in the
matter, I found afterwards was not difficult to account for. One
old man said, as soon as the name was mentioned to him, "Let's
see. Aw'm just thinkin'.... Ay, ay; it's yon heawse opposite
th' owd ho'. They'n bin built up again, lately. An' there
wur writin' an' stuff upo' th' woles; but it took somebory with
a deeal o' larnin' to understond it" When I called upon the
parish-clerk, he told me that a few years ago a gentleman had
called to make inquiry upon the same subject, and left instructions
for everything in the register relating to Tim to be extracted
for him, which was done; but he never called to get the manuscript,
which was now lost or mislaid.</p>

<p>I was a little disappointed at first to find that, wherever I went
in the parish of Flixton, the inhabitants showed no strong interest
in the quaint man of genius, whose early records I was in search
of. But this is no wonder, when one considers what a thinly-inhabited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
place this must have been at the beginning of Queen
Anne's reign; and remembering, also, that nearly the whole of
Tim's long life was spent elsewhere; first, as an apprentice to
Dutch-loom weaving, which was looked upon as a rather genteel
occupation in those days. But, as his friend and biographer,
Richard Townley, Esq., of Bellfield Hall, says, "such a sedentary
employment not at all agreeing with his volatile spirits and eccentric
genius, he prevailed upon his master to release him from
the remainder of his servitude. Though then very young, he
soon commenced itinerant schoolmaster; going about the country
from one small town to another, to teach reading, writing, and
accounts; and generally having a night-school as well as a day
one." Now, seeing that the theatre of these obscure and honourable
struggles of Tim's youth was the town of Oldham, and the
villages thereabouts, it is not surprising that the scattered inhabitants
of the lonely nook where he was born should have few
traditional remembrances of him, who left them when he was
yet but a child. Tim's father was only forty years old, when he
was overtaken by total blindness; and, this, necessarily, changed
the plan he had formed of bringing up his son, our hero, to the
Church, for "he had conceived a favourable opinion of his
abilities." Now, this calamity did not befall the elder Mr.
Collier during the time that he was schoolmaster at Urmston in
Flixton: and everything shows that he was not a native of that
place, but came from some other part to teach there; remaining
only for a short time&mdash;during which Tim and his brother
Nathan were born&mdash;and then moving away again, with his
young family of nine children, to another quarter. What Baines
says, on the authority of the inhabitants of Flixton, of the elder
Collier never being a clergyman, may be true, so far as it relates
to Urmston, of which place there never was a curate; nor was
he in holy orders during his residence there; and yet he may
have been so elsewhere. This supposition is strengthened by
Tim's own words: "In the reign of Queen Anne I was a boy,
and one of the nine children of a poor Lancashire curate, whose
stipend never amounted to thirty pounds a year; and consequently
the family must feel the iron teeth of penury with a witness.
These, indeed, were sometimes blunted by the charitable disposition
of the good rector (the Rev. Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, of W&mdash;&mdash; n)."
What an interesting glimpse this gives us of the home of Tim
Bobbin's childhood! Now, it is just possible that the "good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
rector" may have been the rector of Warrington of that time;
whose name begins with the same initial letter. All things considered,
I did not wonder that the family had left but little mark
among the people of Flixton.</p>

<p>Seeing that so little was known by the inhabitants, I turned
my thoughts towards the parish register, setting an afternoon
apart for visiting the incumbent; who had invited me to look
through it at his house. At the appointed time, I walked through
the village of Flixton, a little way into the country beyond the
village; and there, by the wayside, at the top of a little sloping
lawn, partially screened by stunted trees and bushes, the "village
preacher's modest mansion rose." The incumbent received me
courteously, and entered kindly into my purpose. Ushering me
into a little parlour at the front, he brought forth the two oldest
register volumes of the parish from their hiding-place. The
first thing which struck me was the difference in their condition.
The oldest was perfectly sound, inside and outside. Its leaves
were of vellum; and, with the exception of a slight discolouration
in some places, they were as clear and perfect as ever they had
been; and the entries in it were beautifully distinct, written in
the old English character, and mostly in the Latin language.
The change in the latter volume was very remarkable. Its
binding was poor and shaky; and its leaves of the softest and
most perishable writing paper, many of them quite loose in the
book, and so worn, tattered, and crumbly, as to be scarcely
touchable without damage. I could not help thinking that if
any important question should arise a hundred years hence, the
settling of which depended on such a mouldering record as this,
is was just possible that decay might have forestalled the inquiry.
After a careful examination of the register, I found the following
entries relating to Tim's family, and, besides these, there is no
mention of any other person of the name of Collier, for the space
of half a century before, and a century after that date. First,
under the head of "Births and Baptismes, in the year, 1706,"
appears "Nathan, ye son of John Collier, schoolmaster, borne
May 17, baptised May 31."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Singularly, I found the same baptism
entered a second time, three pages forward in the same year,
with a slight variation, in the following manner:&mdash;"Baptised
Nathan, the son of <i>Master</i> John Collier, schoolmaster, born
May ye 18th." And then the last and only other mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
of the Colliers, is the register of the baptism of John, the
renowned "Tim Bobbin," which is entered thus, among the
baptisms of the year 1710: "John, son of Mr. John Collier, of
Urmstone, baptised January the 6th." In Baines's "Lancashire,"
the baptism is given as occurring in 1709, which is a slight mistake.
The origin of that mistake was evident to me, with the
register before my eyes. The book seems to have been very
irregularly kept in those days; and the baptisms in the year 1709
are entered under a headline, "Baptisms in the year 1709:" but
at the end of the baptisms of that year, the list runs on into those
of the following year, 1710, without any such headline to divide
them; and this entry of Tim's baptism being one of the first,
might easily be transcribed by a hasty observer, as belonging to
the previous year. I thought there was something significant
about the curious manner in which these three entries, relating
to the Colliers, are made in the register. In the first entry of
the baptism of Nathan, Tim's eldest brother, the father is called
"John Collier, schoolmaster;" in the second entry of the same
baptism, he is called "Master John Collier, schoolmaster;" and
in the entry of Tim's baptism, three years later, the clerk, having
written down the father's name as "John Collier of Urmstone,"
has, upon after-thought, made a caret between "the son of" and
"John Collier of Urmstone," and carefully written "Mr." above
it, making it read "Mr. John Collier, of Urmstone." This
addition to the names of schoolmasters, or even of the wealthy
inhabitants of the parish, occurs so very rarely in the register,
that I could not help thinking this singular exception indicative
of an honourable estimate of the character of Tim's father
among his neighbours. Such was the result of my search; and
it strengthens my conviction that old Mr. John Collier's family
were not natives of Flixton, nor dwelt there long, but departed
after a short residence to some other quarter, where the family
were born, married, died, and buried; except the two before
mentioned.</p>

<p>Whilst I was sitting in the incumbent's parlour, looking over
these old books on that day, a little thing befell which pleased
me, though the reader may think it trifling. The weather was
very cold, and I happened to have on one of those red-and-black
tartan wool shirts, which are comfortable wear enough in cold
weather, though they look rather gaudy; and don't satisfy one's
mind so well as a clean white shirt does. As I sat turning over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the leaves of these ancient records, in came the incumbent's son,
a little, slim, intelligent boy, with large, thoughtful eyes. He
watched me attentively for two or three minutes, and then,
coming a little nearer, so as to get a good look at the wrists and
front of my extraordinary under-gear, he called out, with unreserved
astonishment, "Papa! he has got no shirt on!" The
clergyman checked the lad instantly; though he could not help
smiling at this little burst of frank, childish simplicity. The lad
was evidently surprised to see me enjoy the thing so much.</p>

<p>I cannot dismiss this old parish register without noticing some
other things in it which were interesting to me. And I can tell
thee, reader, by the by, that there are worse ways of spending a
few hours than in poring over such a record. How significantly
the births, marriages, and deaths, tread upon one another's heels;
as they do in the columns of newspapers! How solemnly the
decaying pages represent the chequered pattern of our mortal
estate! The exits and entrances of these ephemeral players in
the drama of life continually interweave in the musty chronicle,
as they do in the current of human action. There was a quaint
tone running through the whole, which I could not well pass by.
In the year 1688, the phrase, "buried in woollen only," first
appears, and marks the date of an act for the encouragement of
the woollen trade. This phrase is carefully added to every
registration of burial, thenceforth for a considerable time; except
in a few cases, where the phrase changes to "buried in sweet
flowers only." What a world of mingled pathos and prettiness
that phrase awakes in the mind! To a loving student of Shakspere,
it might, not inaptly, call up that beautiful passage in
Ophelia's burial scene:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Laertes.</i>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lay her i' the earth;&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And from her fair and unpolluted flesh</span><br />
<span class="i0">May violets spring!</span><br />
<span class="i2"><i>Queen.</i> Sweets to the sweet: Farewell!</span><br />
<span class="i16">(<i>Scattering Flowers.</i>)</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>Sometimes an instance occurs where a burial takes place "in
linen only." In this year of 1688, it is singular that there are
only two marriages entered in the Flixton parish register. There
was, perhaps, some particular reason for this at the time; but
the fact will give the reader some idea of the smallness of the
population in those days. From this time the phrase, "Sworn
by so-and-so, before Justice so-and-so," is attached to some entries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
of burial, as thus:&mdash;"Thomas, ye son of John Owen, of Carrington,
buried in sweet floweres, attested by ye wife of George
Twickins. Ye same day of burial, viz., 10th Oct. (1705), John,
ye son of John Millatt, jun., of Carrington, an infant, buried in
sweet floweres only." Then follows, "James Parren was not
buried in any materiall contrary to a late act for Buryinge in
Woollen.&mdash;Sworne by Mary Parren, before Justice Peter Egerton,
Jan. 28th, 1705." The burials in the year 1706 are almost all in
"sweet floweres only." This is the year when Nathan Collier
was born, being the first mention of that family in the register.
Three years after, his brother John (Tim Bobbin) was born;
after which the Colliers disappear from the register altogether.
Some of the burials occurring between 1720 and 1726, are
remarkable for the manner of their entry, as, "Sarah, daughter
of Schoolmaster Pony;" "James, Thomas Jaddock's father;"
"John Swindell, taken out of ye river;" "Widow Peer's child,
Aug. 5th;" and this is followed three days after by "Richd.,
son of Widow Peer's, Aug. 30th;" "Old Ralph Haslam, from
Carrington;" "Old Henery Roile, from Stretford;" "Old Mrs.
Starkey;" "Old John Groons;" "Moss's wife of Urmeston;"
"Horox's child of Urmstone;" and "Hannah, daughter of one
Dean, of Stretford." Then come these, in their proper order,
entered in a clerkly hand:&mdash;"Thomas Willis, of Bleckly, in the
county of Buckingham, Esq., and Mrs. Ann Hulme, Heiress of
Davy Hulme, and of the lordship and manor of Urmston, were
marry'd. Sept. 3rd, 1735;" and then "Anna Willis, the first
daughter of Thomas Willis, Esq., born August the 11th, 1736,
and baptised ye 14th Aug.&mdash;<span class="smcap">John Willis</span>, clerk of Bleckley, in
Bucks." I found the Christian name of Randal very common
in this register. The names of Starkey, Holt, Rogers, and Egerton,
ever accompanied by the title of gentleman; and for the
rest, the names of Warburton, Taylor, Royle, Coupe, Darbishire,
Shawcross, Gilbody, and Knight, form the staple of the list,
with the addition of the Owens of Carrington Moss; who seem
to have been a very prolific generation.</p>

<p>The people of southern England are apt to sneer at the enthusiasm
with which Lancashire men speak of Tim Bobbin; and, if
this imperfect sketch should fall into the hands of any such readers,
it is not improbable that they may look upon the whole thing as
a great fuss about next to nothing. One reason for this is, that,
for the most part, they know next to nothing of the man&mdash;which
is not much to be wondered at. But the greatest difficulty in
their case is the remote character of the words and idioms used
by Tim. To the majority of such readers, the dialogue of
"Tummus and Mary" is little more than an unintelligible curiosity;
and I believe, speaking generally, that it would be better
understood by the natives of the metropolis if it had been written
in French. The language in which the commanding genius of
Chaucer wrought, five hundred years ago, and which was the
common language of the London of those days, is, even in its
most idiomatic part, very much the same as that used in all the
country parts of Lancashire at this hour. But great changes
have come round since the time of Chaucer; and though an
Englishman is an Englishman in general characteristics, all the
world over, there is as much difference now in the tone of manners
and language in the North and South as there is between
the tones of an organ and those of a piano. I have hardly ever
met with a southern man able to comprehend the quaint, graphic
wealth which hutches and chuckles with living fun and country
humour, under the equally quaint garb of old language in which
Tim clothes his story of "Tummus and Mary." But, on its
first appearance, the people of his own district at once recognised
an exquisite picture of themselves; and they hailed it with
delight. He superintended several editions of his works during
his lifetime&mdash;a time when the population of Lancashire was
very scanty, and scattered over large, bleak spaces; and when
publishing was a very different thing to what it is now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
Since then, his principal story has continually grown in the
estimation of scholars and students, as a valuable addition to the
rich treasures of English philology, even apart from the genius
which combined its humorous details with such masterly art,
and finished and rounded it into the completeness of a literary
dewdrop. That tale was calculated to command attention and
awaken delight at once&mdash;and it will long be cherished with pride,
by Lancashire men at least, as an exceedingly natural "glimpse
of auld lang syne." But those who wish to understand the force
of Tim's character, must look to his letters, and other prose fragments,
such as "Truth in a Mask." These chiefly reveal the
sterling excellence of the man. He was a clear-sighted, daring,
independent politician&mdash;one of the strong old pioneers of human
freedom in these parts. He had a curious audience in that secluded
corner of Lancashire where he lived&mdash;in those days&mdash;a people
who had worn their political shackles so long that they almost
looked upon them as ornaments.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But <i>Tim</i> kent what was fu brawly;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>and he was continually blurting out some startling truth or another,
in vigorous, unmistakable English; and he gloried in the then
disreputable and dangerous epithet of "Reforming John." This,
too, in the teeth of patrons and friends whose political tendencies
were in an entirely opposite direction. Let any man turn to the
letter he writes to his friend, the Rev. Mr. Heap, of Dorking,
who had desired him to "spare the levitical order," and then say
whether there was any shadow of sycophancy in the soul of
John Collier. Under the correction of magnifying the matter
through the medium of one's native likings then, I will venture
to declare a feeling akin to veneration for the spot where he was
born; and I know that it is shared by the men of his native
county, generally, even by those who find themselves at a difficult
distance from his quaint tone of thought and language&mdash;for it
takes a man thoroughly soaked with the Lancashire soil to appreciate
him thoroughly. But, apart from all local inclinings, men
of thought and feeling will ever welcome any spark of genuine
creative fire, which glows with such genial human sympathies,
and such an honourable sense of justice as John Collier evinces,
however humble it may be in comparison with the achievements
of those mighty spirits who have made the literature
of our sea-girt island glorious in the earth. The waters of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
little mountain stream, singing its lone, low song, as it struggles
through its rocky channel, are dear and beautiful, and useful
to that rugged solitude, as is the great ocean to the shores on
which its surges play. Nay, what is that ocean, but the
gathered chorus of these lonely waters, in which the individual
voice is lost in one grand combination of varied tones. With
this imperfect notice, I will, at present, leave our old local
favourite; and just take another glance at Flixton, before I bid
adieu to his birthplace.</p>

<p>The reader may remember that, on the day of my first visit
to John Collier's birthplace, I lounged some time about the
hamlet of Urmston, conversing with the inhabitants. Leaving
that spot, I rambled leisurely along the high road to Flixton,
hob-nobbing, and inquiring among different sorts of people, about
him, whenever opportunity offered. When I drew near to Shaw
Hall, I had traversed a considerable part of the length of the
parish, which is only four miles, at most, by about two in
breadth. There is nothing like a hill to be seen; but as one
wanders on, the country rises and falls, in gentle undulations.
Now and then, a pool of water gleamed afar off in the green
fields, or, close by the road, rippled into wavelets by the keen
wind, which came down steadily from the north that day,
whistling shrill cadences among the starved thorns. I cannot
give a better idea of the character of the soil than by borrowing
the words of Baines, who says: "Much of the land in the parish
of Flixton is arable, probably to the amount of nine-tenths of
the whole. The farms are comparatively large, and the soil is
in general a rich black, sandy, vegetable loam, producing corn,
fruit, and potatoes in abundance." I believe the land is now in
better cultivation than when these words were written. Shaw
Hall is an important place in the history of Flixton. The lords
of the land dwelt there in old times. At the time of my visit it
was occupied, as a boarding-school, by Mr. James M'Dougall,
who was kind enough to show me through the interior when I
called there in my ramble. Baines says of Shaw Hall: "It is a
venerable mansion, of the age of James I., with gables and
wooden parapets on the S. W. and N. sides. The roof has a
profusion of chimneys, and a cupola in the centre. In one of
the apartments is a painting covering the principal part of the
ceiling, which represents the family of Darius kneeling in supplication
before Alexander the Great. This picture, though two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
hundred years old, is in fine preservation, and the faces and
figures indicate the hand of a master. There are some smaller
paintings and tapestry in the rooms, on one of which is represented
a Persian chief at parley with Alexander, and, afterwards,
submitting to the conqueror. Stained glass in the windows
exhibit the arms of Asshawe and Egerton, successive lords of
Flixton.... Adjoining the ample gardens and filbert grove
was once a moat, which has partly disappeared. Shaw Hall is
now used as a boarding-school, a purpose to which, by its situation,
it seems well adapted." I cannot leave this place without
mentioning, that the, then, tenant of the hall was a poet of no mean
promise, who has contributed an interesting volume of poems
and songs to the literature of this district. From the high road,
a little beyond the hall, the most prominent and pleasing object
in the landscape is the old parish church of Flixton, standing in
its still more ancient graveyard, upon the brow of a green knoll,
about an arrow's flight off; with the village of Flixton clustered
behind it. At the foot of that green knoll, to the westward,
where all the country beyond is one unbroken green,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The river glideth by the hamlet old.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>The ground occupied by the church seemed to me the highest
in the landscape; and the venerable fane stands there, looking
round upon the quiet parish like a mother watching her children
at play, and waiting till they come home, tired, to lie down and
sleep with the rest. It was getting late in the evening when I
sauntered about the churchyard, looking over the gravestones of
Warburtons, Taylors, Cowpes, Gilbodys, Egertons, and Owens
of Carrington. Among the rest, I found the following well-known
epitaph, upon William Oldfield of Stretford, smith:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My anvil and my hammer lie declined,</span><br />
<span class="i0">My bellows have quite lost their wind;</span><br />
<span class="i0">My coals are done, my debt is paid,</span><br />
<span class="i0">My vices in the dust are laid.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>This epitaph, which appears here in such an imperfect shape, is
commonly attributed to Tim. In Rochdale parish churchyard,
it appears in a much completer form on the gravestone of a
blacksmith, who lived in Tim's time.</p>

<p>I rambled about the old village a while in the dusk. Now and
then a villager lounged along in the direction of the inn, near the
church; where I could hear several boisterous country fellows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
talking together in high glee, while one of them sang snatches of
an old ballad, called the "Golden Glove:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Coat, waistcoat, and breeches she then did put on,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And a-hunting she went with her dog and gun;</span><br />
<span class="i0">She hunted all around where the farmer did dwell,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Because in her heart she did love him full well.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>At length the horses were put to, and we got fairly upon the
road, which took us back in another direction, round by Davy
Hulme, the seat of the Norreys family. Immediately after
clearing the village, Flixton House was pointed out to me;
"a plain family mansion, with extensive grounds and gardens."
The wind was cold, and the shades of night gathered fast around;
and before we quitted Flixton parish, the birthplace of Tim
Bobbin had faded from my view. I felt disappointed in finding
that the place of his nativity yielded so little reminiscence of our
worthy old local humorist; the simple reason for which is, that
very little is known of him there. But there was compensating
pleasure to me in meeting with so many interesting things there
which I did not go in search of.</p>

<p class="drop-capi1"><span class="smcap">Well</span> may Englishmen cherish the memory of their forefathers,
and love their native land. It has risen to its
present power among the nations of the world through
the efforts of many generations of heroic people; and
the firmament of its biography is illumined by stars of the first
magnitude. What we know of its history previous to the conquest
by the Romans, is clouded by conjecture and romance;
but we have sufficient evidence to show that, even then, this
gem, "set in the silver sea," was known in distant regions of the
earth, for its natural riches; and was inhabited by a brave and
ingenious race of people. During the last two thousand years,
the masters of the world have been fighting to win it, or to keep
it. The woad-stained British savage, ardent, imaginative, and
brave, roved through its woods and marshes, hunting the wild
beasts of the island. He sometimes herded cattle, but was little
given to tillage. He sold tin to the Ph&oelig;nicians, and knew
something about smelting iron ore, and working it into such
shapes as were useful in a life of wild insecurity and warfare,
such as his. In the slim coracle, he roamed the island's waters;
and scoured its plains in battle, in his scythed car, a terror
to the boldest foe. He worshipped, too, in an awful way,
in sombre old woods, and colossal Stonehenges, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
blue, o'er-arching sky. On lone wastes, and moorland hills, we
still have the relics of these ancient temples, frowning at time,
and seeming to say, as they look on nature's ever-returning
green,&mdash;in the words of their old Druids&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Everything comes out of the ground but the dead.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>But destiny had other things in store for these islands. The
legions of imperial Rome came down upon the wild Celt, who
retired, fiercely contending, to the mountain fastnesses of the
north and west. Four hundred years the Roman wrought
and ruled in Britain; and he left the broad red mark of his
way of living stamped upon the face of the country, and
upon its institutions, when his empire declined. The steadfast
Saxon followed,&mdash;"stubborn, taciturn, sulky, indomitable, rock-made,"&mdash;a
farmer and a fighter; a man of sense, and spirit, and
integrity; an industrious man, and a home-bird. The Saxon
never loosed his hold; even though his wild Scandinavian kinsmen,
the sea-kings, and jarls of the north, came rushing to battle,
with their piratical multitudes, tossing their swords into the air,
and singing heroic ballads, as they slew their foemen, under the
banner of the Black Raven. Then came the military Norman,&mdash;a
northern pirate, trained in France to the art of war,&mdash;led on
by the bold Duke William, who landed his warriors at Pevensey,
and burnt the fleet that brought them to the shore, in order to
bind his soldiers to the necessity of victory or death. Duke
William conquered, and Harold, the Saxon, fell at Hastings,
with an arrow in his brain. Each of these races has left its
peculiarities stamped upon the institutions of the country; but
most enduring of all,&mdash;the Saxon. And now, the labours of
twenty centuries of valiant men, in peace and war, have achieved
a matchless power, and freedom for us, and have bestrewn
the face of the land with "the charms which follow long
history." The country of Caractacus and Boadicea, where
Alfred ruled, and Shakspere and Milton sang, will henceforth
always be interesting to men of intelligent minds, wherever they
were born. It is pleasant, also, to the eye, as it is instructive
to the mind. Its history is written all over the soil, not only
in strong evidences of its present genius and power, but in
thousands of relics of its ancient fame and characteristics. In a
letter, written by Lord Jeffrey, to his sister-in-law, an American
lady, respecting what Old England is like, and in what it differs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
most from America, he says: "It differs mostly, I think, in the
visible memorials of antiquity with which it is overspread; the
superior beauty of its verdure, and the more tasteful and happy
state and distribution of its woods. Everything around you here
is historical, and leads to romantic or interesting recollections.
Gray-grown church towers, cathedrals, ruined abbeys, castles of
all sizes and descriptions, in all stages of decay, from those that
are inhabited, to those in whose moats ancient trees are growing,
and ivy mantling over their mouldering fragments; ... and
massive stone bridges over lazy waters; and churches that look as
old as Christianity; and beautiful groups of branchy trees; and
a verdure like nothing else in the universe; and all the cottages
and lawns fragrant with sweet briar and violets, and glowing
with purple lilacs and white elders; and antique villages scattering
round wide bright greens; with old trees and ponds, and a massive
pair of oaken stocks preserved from the days of Alfred.
With you everything is new, and glaring, and angular, and withal
rather frail, slight, and perishable; nothing soft, and mellow, and
venerable, or that looks as if it would ever become so." This
charming picture is almost entirely compounded from the most
interesting features of the rural and antique: and is, therefore,
more applicable to those agricultural parts of England which
have been little changed by the events of its modern history,
than to those districts which have been so changed by the
peaceful revolutions of manufacture in these days. But, even
in the manufacturing districts, where forests of chimneys rear
their tall shafts, upon ground once covered with the woodland
shade, or sparsely dotted with quaint hamlets,&mdash;the venerable
monuments of old English life peep out in a beautiful way,
among crowding evidences of modern power and population.
And the influences which have so greatly changed the appearance
of the country there, have not passed over the people
without effect. Wherever the genius of commerce may be
leading us to, there is no doubt that the old controls of
feudalism are breaking up; and in the new state of things
the people of South Lancashire have found greater liberty to
improve their individual qualities and conditions; fairer chances
of increasing their might and asserting their rights; greater
power to examine and understand all questions which come
before them, and to estimate and influence their rulers, than they
had under the unreasoning domination which is passing away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
They are not a people inclined to anarchy. They love order as
well as freedom, and they love freedom for the sake of having
order established upon just principles.</p>

<p>The course of events during the last fifty years has been
steadily upheaving the people of South Lancashire out of the
thraldom of those orders which have long striven to conserve
such things as tended to their own aggrandisement, at the
expense of the rights of others. But even that part of the
aristocracy of England which has not yet so far cast the slough
of its hereditary prejudices as to see that the days are gone
which nurtured such ascendancies, at least perceives that, in the
manufacturing districts, it now walks in a world where few are
disposed to accept its assumption of superiority, without inquiring
into the nature of it. When a people who aspire to independence,
begin to know how to get it, and how to use it wisely,
the methods of rule that were made for slaves, will no longer
answer their purpose; the pride of little minds in great places,
begins to canker them, and they must give them the wall now
and then, and look somewhere else for foot-lickers. The aristocracy
of England are not all of them overwhelmed by the
dignity of their "ancient descent." There are naturally-noble
men among them, who can discern between living truth and
dead tradition; men who do not think that the possession of
a landed estate entitles its owner to extraordinary rights of
domination over his acreless neighbours; or that, on that
account alone, the rest of the world should fall down and
worship at the feet of an ordinary person, more remarkable
for an incomprehensible way of deporting himself, than for
being a better man than his neighbours.</p>

<p>Through the streets of South Lancashire towns still, occasionally,
roll the escutcheoned equipages of those exclusive families,
who turn up the nose at the "lower orders;" and cherish a
dim remembrance of the "good old times" when these lurdanes
wore the collars of their ancestors upon the neck. To my
thinking, the very carriage has a sort of lonely, unowned and
unowning look, and never seems at home till it gets back
to the coach-house; for the troops of factory lads, and other
hard-working rabble, clatter merrily about the streets, looking
villainously unconscious of anything particularly august in the
nature of the show which is going by. On the driving-box sits
a man with a beefy face, and a comically-subdued way of holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
his countenance, grand over all with "horse-gowd," and
gilt buttons, elaborate with heraldic device. Another such
person, with silky calves, and a "smoke-jack" upon his hat,
and breeches of plush, stands on the platform behind. It is
all no use. There are corners of England where such a sight
is still enough to throw a whole village into fits; but, in the
manufacturing towns, a travelling instalment of Wombwell's
menagerie, with the portrait of a cub rhinoceros in front, would
create more stir. Inside the carriage there reclines,&mdash;chewing
the cud of unacknowledged pride,&mdash;one of that rare brood of
dignitaries, a man with "ancestors," who plumes himself upon
the distinguished privilege of being the son of somebody or
another, who was the son of somebody else, and so on;&mdash;till it
gets to some burglarious person, who, in company with several
others of the same kidney, once pillaged an old estate, robbed a
church, and did many other such deeds, in places where the
law was too weak to protect the weak; and there is an eternal
blazon of armorial fuss kept up in celebration of it, on the family
shield. But, admitting that these things were in keeping with
the spirit and necessities of the time, and with "the right of
conquest," and such like, why should their descendants take
to themselves airs on that account, and consider themselves
the supreme "somebodies" of the land, for such worn-out
reasons? Let any landlord who still tunes his pride according
to the feudal gamut of his forefathers, acquaint himself with
the tone of popular feeling in the manufacturing districts.
Let "John" lower the steps, and with earth-directed eyes
hold the carriage door, whilst our son of a hundred fathers
walks forth into the streets of a manufacturing town, to
try the magic of his ancient name among the workmen as
they hurry to dinner. Where are the hat-touchers gone? If
he be a landlord, with nothing better than tracts of earth to
recommend him, the mechanical rabble jostle him as if he
was "only a pauper whom nobody owns," or some wandering
cow-jobber. He goes worshipless on his way, unless he happens
to meet with one of the servants from the hall, or his butcher,
or the parish clerk, or the man who rings the eight o'clock bell,
and they treat him to a bend sinister. As to the pride of "ancient
descent," what does it mean, apart from the renown of noble
deeds? The poor folk in Lancashire cherish an old superstition
that "we're o' somebory's childer,"&mdash;which would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
found very near the truth, if fairly looked into. And if Collop
the cotton weaver's genealogy was correctly traced, it would
probably run back to the year "one;" or, as he expresses it himself,
to the time "when Adam wur a lad." Everything has its
day. In some parts of Lancashire, the rattle of the railway train,
and the bustle of traffic and labour, have drowned the tones of
the hunting horn, and the chiming cry of the harriers. But
whatever succeeds the decay of feudalism, the architectural relics
of Old English life in Lancashire will always be interesting,
and venerable as the head of a fine old man, on whose brow
"the snow-fall of time" has long been stealing. May no
ruder hand than the hand of time destroy these eloquent
footprints of old thought which remain among us! Some
men are like Burns's mouse,&mdash;the present only touches them;
but any man who has the slightest title to the name of a
creature of "large discourse," will be willing, now and then,
to look contemplatively over his shoulder, into the grass-grown
aisles of the past.</p>

<p>It was in that pleasant season of the year when fresh buds
begin to shoot from the thorn: when the daisy and the little
celandine, and the early primrose, peep from the ground, that I
began to plot for another stroll through my native vale of the
Roch, up to the top of "Blackstone Edge." Those mountain
wastes are familiar to me. When I was a child, they rose
up constantly in sight, with a silent, majestic look. The sun
came from behind them in a morning, pouring its flood of
splendour upon the busy valley, the winding river, and its
little tributaries. I imbibed a strong attachment to those hills;
and oft as opportunity would allow, I rushed towards them;
for they were kindly and congenial to my mind. And now, in
the crowded city, when I think of them and of the country they
look down upon, it stirs within me a</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wide sea that one continuous murmur breaks</span><br />
<span class="i0">Along the pebbled shore of memory.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>But at this particular time, an additional motive enticed me
to my old wandering ground. The whole of the road leading
to it was lined with interesting places, and associations. But,
among the railways, and manifold other ways and means
of travel, which now cover the country with an irregular
net-work, I found, on looking over a recent map, a solitary
line running in short, broken distances; and, on the approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
of towns and habited spots, diving under, like a mole or an
otter. It looked like a broken thread, here and there, in
the mazy web of the map, and it was accompanied by the
words "Roman Road," which had a little interest for me. I
know there are people who would sneer at the idea of any
importance being attached to an impracticable, out-of-the-way
road, nearly two thousand years old, and leading to nowhere in
particular, except, like the ways of the wicked, into all sorts of
sloughs and difficulties. With them, one passable macadamised
way, on which a cart could go to market, is worth all the ruined
Watling-streets in Britain. And they are right, so far as their
wisdom goes. The present generation must be served with
market stuff, come what may of our museums. But still, everything
in the world is full of manifold services to man, who is
himself full of manifold needs. And thought can leave the
telegraphic message behind, panting for breath upon the railway
wires. The whole is either "cupboard for food," or "cabinet
of pleasure;" therefore, let the hungry soul look round upon its
estate and turn the universe to nutriment, if it can; for</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">There's not a breath</span><br />
<span class="i0">Will mingle kindly with the meadow air,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Till it has panted round, and stolen a share</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of passion from the heart.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>And though the moorland pack-horse and the rambling besom-maker
stumble and get entangled in grass, and sloughs, and matted
brushwood, upon deserted roads, still that nimble Mercury,
Thought, can flit over the silent waste, side by side with the
shades of those formidable soldiers who have now slept nearly
two thousand years in the cold ground.</p>

<p>It has not been my lot to see many of the vestiges of Roman
life in Britain; yet, whatever the historians say about them has
had interest for me; especially when it related to the connection
of the Romans with my native district; for, in addition
to its growing modern interest, I eagerly seized every fact of
historical association calculated to enrich the vesture in which
my mind had long been enrobing the place. I had read of the
Roman station at Littleborough; of the Roman road in the
neighbourhood; of interesting ancient relics, Roman and other,
discovered thereabouts; and other matter of the like nature.
My walks had been wide and frequent in the country about
Rochdale; and many a time have I lingered and wondered at
Littleborough, near the spot where history says that the Romans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
encamped themselves, at the foot of Blackstone Edge, at the
entrance of what would, then, be the impassable hills, and woody
glens, and swampy bottoms of the Todmorden district. Yet I
have never met with any visible remnants of such historical
antiquities of the locality; and though, when wandering about
the high moors in that quarter, I have more than once crossed
the track of the Roman road up there, and noticed a general
peculiarity of feature about the place, I little thought that I was
floundering, through moss and heather, upon one of these famous
old highways. I endeavoured to hold the bit upon my own
eagerness; and read of these things with a reservation of credence,
lest I should delude myself into receiving the invention
of a brain mad with ancientry for a genuine relic of the eld.
But one day, early in the year, happening to call upon a young
friend of mine, in Rochdale, whose tastes are a little congenial
to my own, we talked of a stroll towards the hills; and he again
showed me the line of the Roman road, on Blackstone Edge,
marked in the recent Ordnance map. We then went forth,
bare-headed, into the yard of his father's house, at Wardleworth
Brow, from whence the view of the hills, on the east, is fine.
The air was clear, and the sunshine so favourably subdued, that
the objects and tints of the landscape were uncommonly distinct.
He pointed to a regular stripe of land, of greener hue than the
rest of the moorland, rising up the dark side of Blackstone Edge.
The green stripe was the line of the Roman road. He had lately
visited it, and traced its uniform width for miles, and the peculiarities
of its pavement of native sandstone, overgrown with a
thick tanglement of moss, and heather, and moorland lichens.
He was an old acquaintance, of known integrity, and sound
judgment, and, withal, more addicted to figures of arithmetic
than figures of speech; so, upon his testimony, I resolved that
I would bring my unstable faith to the ordeal of ocular proof,
that I might, at once, draft it out of the region of doubt, or
sweep it from the chambers of my brain, like a festoonery
of cobwebs from a neglected corner, The prospect of another
visit to the scenery of the "Edge," another snuff of the
mountain air, and a little more talk with the old-world
folk in the villages upon the road thither, rose up pleasantly
in my mind, and the purpose took the shape of action about
St. Valentine's tide.</p>

<p>Having arranged to be called up at five on the morning of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
intended trip, I jumped out of bed when the knock came to my
chamber-door, dressed, and started forth to catch the first train
from Manchester. The streets were silent and still, except
where one or two "early birds" of the city had gathered round
a "saloop" stall; or a solitary policeman kept the lounging
tenor of his way along the pavement; and here and there a
brisk straggler, with a pipe in his mouth, his echoing steps
contrasting strangely with the sleeping city's morning stillness.
The day was ushered in with gusts of wind and rain, and,
when I got to the station, both my coat and my expectations
were a little damped by the weather. But, by the time the train
reached Rochdale, the sky had cleared up, and the breeze had
sunk down to a whisper, just cool enough to make the sunshine
pleasant. The birds were twittering about, and drops of rain
twinkled on the hedges and tufts of grass in the fields; where
spring was quietly spreading out her green mantle again. I
wished to have as wide a ramble at the farther end as time would
allow; and, as moor-tramping is about the most laborious foot
exercise that mortal man can bend his instep to, except running
through a ploughed field, in iron-plated clogs,&mdash;an ordeal which
Lancashire trainers sometimes put their foot-racers through,&mdash;it
was considered advisable to hire a conveyance. We could go
further, stop longer, and return at ease, when we liked, after we
had tired ourselves to our heart's content upon the moors. I
went down to the Reed Inn, for a vehicle. Mine host came
out to the top of the steps which lead down into the stable-yard,
and, leaning over the railings, called his principal ostler from the
room below. That functionary was a broad-set, short-necked
man, with a comely face, and a staid, laconic look. He told us,
with Spartan brevity, that there had been a run upon gigs, but
he could find us a "Whitechapel," and "Grey Bobby." "Grey
Bobby" and the "Whitechapel" were agreed to at once, and in
ten minutes I was driving up Yorkshire-street, to pick up my
friends at Wardleworth Brow, on the eastern edge of the town.
Giving the reins to a lad in the street, I went into the house,
and took some refreshment with the rest of them, before starting;
and, in a few minutes more, we were all seated, and away down
the slope of Heybrook, on the Littleborough Road. Our tit had
a mercurial trick of romping on his hind legs, at the start; but
apart from this, he went a steady, telling pace, and we looked
about us quite at ease as we sped along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>Heybrook, at the foot of Wardleworth Brow, is one of the
pleasantest entrances to Rochdale town. There is a touch of
suburban peace and prettiness about it; and the prospect, on all
sides, is agreeable to the eye. The park-like lands of Foxholes
and Hamer lie close by the north side of the road. The lower
part of these grounds consists of rich, flat meadows, divided by
a merry little brook, which flows from the hills on the north,
above "Th' Syke." In its course from the moors, to the river
Roch, it takes the name of each locality it passes through, and is
called "Syke Brook," "Buckley Brook," and "Hey Brook;"
and, on its way, it gathers tributary rindles of water from
Clough House, Knowl, and Knowl Syke. As the Foxholes
grounds recede from the high road, they undulate, until they rise
into an expansive, lawny slope, clothed with a verdure which
looks&mdash;when wet with summer rain or dew&mdash;"like nothing else
in the universe," out of England. This slope is tastefully crowned
with trees. Foxholes Hall is situated among its old woods and
lawns, retiringly, upon the summit of this swelling upland, which
rises from the level of Heybrook. It is a choice corner of the
earth, and the view thence, between the woods, across the lawn
and meadows, and over a picturesquely-varied country, to the
blue hills in the south-east, is perhaps not equalled in the neighbourhood.
Pleasant and green as much of the land in this district
looks now, still the general character of the soil, and the whole
of its features, shows that when nature had it to herself very
much of it must have been sterile or swampy. Looking towards
Foxholes, from the road-side at Heybrook, over the tall ancestral
trees, we can see the still taller chimney of John Bright and
Brothers' mill, peering up significantly behind; and the sound
of their factory bell now mingles with the cawing of an ancient
colony of rooks in the Foxholes woods. Foxholes is the seat of
the Entwisles, a distinguished old Lancashire family. In the time
of Camden, the historian, this family was seated at Entwisle Hall,
near Bolton-le-Moors. George Entwisle de Entwisle left as heir
his brother William, who married Alice, daughter of Bradshaw,
of Bradshaw. His son Edmund, the first Entwisle of Foxholes,
near Rochdale, built the old hall, which stood on the site of the
present one. He married a daughter of Arthur Ashton, of Clegg;
and his son Richard married Grace, the daughter of Robert
Chadwick, of Healey Hall. In the parish church there is a
tablet to the memory of Sir Bertin Entwisle, who fought at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Agincourt, on St. Crispin's Day, in Henry the Fifth's time.
When a lad, I used to con over this tablet, and I wove a
world of romance around this mysterious "Sir Bertin," and
connected him with all that I had heard of the prowess of old
English chivalry. The tablet runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To perpetuate a memorial erected in the church of St Peter's, St. Albans (perished
by time), this marble is here placed to the memory of a gallant and loyal man&mdash;Sir
Bertin Entwisle, Knt., viscount and baron of Brybeke, in Normandy, and some time
bailiff of Constantine, in which office he succeeded his brother-in-law, Sir John
Ashton, whose daughter first married Sir Richard le Byron, an ancestor of the Lords
Byron, of Rochdale, and, secondly, Sir Bertin Entwisle, who, after repeated acts of
honour in the service of his sovereigns, Henrys the Fifth and Sixth, more particularly
at Agincourt, was killed in the first battle of St Albans, and on his tombstone
was recorded in brass the follow inscription:&mdash;"Here lyeth Sir Bertin Entwisle,
Knight, who was born in Lancastershyre, and was viscount and baron of Brybeke,
in Normandy, and bailiff of Constantine, who died, fighting on King Henry the
Sixth's party, the 28th May 1455, on whose soul Jesus have mercy."</p></blockquote>

<p>Close by the stone-bridge at Heybrook, two large old trees stand
in the Entwisle grounds, one on each bank of the stream, and
partly overhanging the road; they stand there alone, as if to
mark where a forest has been. The tired country weaver,
carrying his piece to the town, lays down his burden on the
parapet, wipes his brow, and rests under their shade. I have
gone sometimes, on bright nights, to lean upon the bridge and
look around there, and I have heard many a plaintive trio sung
by these old trees and the brook below, while the moonlight
danced among the leaves.</p>

<p>The whole valley of the Roch is a succession of green knolls,
and dingles, and little receding vales, with now and then a barren
stripe, like "Cronkeyshaw," or a patch of the once large mosses,
like "Turf Moss;" and little holts and holms, no two alike in
feature or extent, dotted, now and then, with tufts of stunted
wood, with many a clear brook and silvery rill between. On
the south side of the bridge at Heybrook, the streamlet from the
north runs through the meadows a short distance, and empties
itself into the Roch. The confluence of the waters there is
known to the neighbour lads by the name of the "Greyt
Meetin's," where, in past years, I have</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Paidle't through the burn</span><br />
<span class="i0">When simmer days were fine,</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>in a certain young companionship&mdash;now more scattered than last
autumn's leaves; some in other towns, one or two only still here,
and the rest in Australia, or in the grave. We now no longer
strip in the field there, and leaving our clothes and books upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
the hedge side, go frolicking down to the river, to have a
water battle and a bathe&mdash;finishing by drying ourselves with
our shirts, or by running in the wind on the green bank. I
remember that sometimes, whilst we were in the height of our
sport, the sentinel left upon the brink of the river would catch
a glimpse of the owner of the fields, coming hastily towards the
spot, in wrathful mood; whereupon every naked imp rushed
from the water, seized his clothes, and fled from field to field,
till he reached some nook where he could put them on. From
the southern margin of the Roch, the land rises in a green elevation,
on which the hamlet of Belfield is seen peeping up. The
tree-tops of Belfield Wood are in sight, but the ancient hall is
hidden. A little vale on the west, watered by the Biel, divides
Belfield Hall from the hamlet of Newbold, on the summit of the
opposite bank. So early as the commencement of the twelfth
century, a family had adopted the local name, and resided in the
mansion till about the year 1290, when the estate was transferred
to the family of Butterworth, of Butterworth Hall, near Milnrow.
I find the Belfield family mentioned in Gastrel's "Notitia
Cestriensis," p. 40, under the head "Leases granted by the
bishop," where the following lease appears:&mdash;"An. 1546. Let
by H. Ar. Belfield and Robt. Tatton, for 40 years, exceptis
omus vicariis advocationibus ecclesiariu quarumcunque, (ing) to
find great timber, tiles, and slate, and tenants to repair and find
all other materials." The following note is attached to this
lease:&mdash;"Arthur Belfield, of Clegg Hall, in the parish of Rochdale,
gent., son and heir of Adam Belfield, was born in 1508,
and succeeded his father in 1544. He is described in the lease
as 'off our sayde sovaraigne lord's houshold, gentylman;' but
what office he held is, at present, unknown. He was a near
relative of the Hopwoods, of Hopwood, and Chethams, of
Nuthurst." In the year 1274, Geoffry de Butterworth, a descendent
of Reginald de Boterworth, first lord of the township
of Butterworth, in the reign of Stephen, 1148, sold or exchanged
the family mansion of Butterworth Hall, with John Byron, ancestor
of Lord Byron, the poet, and took possession (by purchase
or otherwise) of Belfield, which was part of the original possession
of the knights of St. John of Jerusalem. When the monks of
Stanlaw, in Cheshire&mdash;disliking their low, swampy situation
there, which was subject to inundation at spring tide&mdash;removed
to the old deanery of Whalley, before entering the abbey there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
in the roll of the fraternity four seem to have been natives of
Rochdale, among whom was John de Belfield, afterwards Abbot
of Whalley, of the ancient stock of Belfield Hall, in Butterworth.
Robert de Butterworth was killed at the battle of Towton, in
1461. The last of the name, at Belfield, was Alexander Butterworth,
born in 1640, in the reign of Charles the First. The
present occupants of the estate have tastefully preserved the
old interesting features of the hall, whilst they have greatly
improved its condition and environments. The stone gateway,
leading to the inner court-yard of Belfield Hall, is still standing,
as well as a considerable portion of the old hall which surrounded
this inner court. The antique character of the building is best
seen from the quadrangular court-yard in the centre. The door
of the great kitchen formerly opened into this court-yard, and
the victuals used to be brought out thence, and handed by the
cooks through a square opening in the wall of the great dining-room,
on the north side of the yard, to the waiters inside. The
interior of the building still retains many quaint features of
its olden time&mdash;heavy oak-beams, low ceilings, and tortuous
corners. Every effort has been made to line the house with an
air of modern comfort; still the house is said to be a cold one,
partly from its situation, and partly from the porous nature of
the old walls; producing an effect something like that of a
wine-cooler. That part of the building which now forms the
rear, used, in old times, to be the main front. In one of the
rooms, there are still some relics of the ancient oak-carving
which lined the walls of the hall. Among them there are
three figures in carved oak, which formed part of the wainscot
of a cornice, above one of the fire-places. These were the
figures of a king and two queens, quaintly cut; and the remnants
of old painting upon the figures, and the rich gilding
upon the crowns, still show traces of their highly-ornamented,
ancient appearance. The roads in the neighbourhood of the
hall are now good. The hamlets of Newbold and Belfield are
thriving, with substantial, healthy dwellings. Shady walks are
laid among the plantations; and the springs of excellent water
are now gathered into clear terraced pools and a serpentine lake,
glittering among gardens and cultivated grounds.</p>

<p>Leaving Heybrook, we passed by Hamer Hall, which was
the seat of a family of the same name, before Henry the Fourth's
time. A large cotton-mill now stands close behind the hall. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
few yards through the toll-bar, we passed the "Entwisle Arms,"
bearing the motto, "Par se signe à Azincourt." A traveller
seldom needs to ask the names of the old lords of the land in
England. Let him keep an eye to the sign-boards, and he is
sure to find that part of the history of the locality swinging in
the wind, or stapled up over the entrance of some neighbouring
alehouse. And, in the same barmy atmosphere, he may learn,
at least, as much heraldry as he will be able to find a market for
on the Manchester Exchange. The public-house signs in our
old towns are generally very loyal and heraldic, and sometimes
touched with a little jovial devotion. The arms of kings, queens,
and bishops; and mitres, chapel-houses, angels, and "amen
corners," mingling with "many a crest that is famous in story;"
the arms of the Stanleys, Byrons, Asshetons, Traffords, Lacys,
Wiltons, De-la-Warres, Houghtons, Molyneuxs, Pilkingtons,
Radcliffes, and a long roll of old Lancashire gentry, whose fame
is faintly commemorated in these alehouse signs; and, among the
mottoes of these emblazonments, we now and then meet with
an ancient war-cry, which makes one's blood start into tumult,
when we think how it may have sounded on the fields of Cressy,
Agincourt, Towton, or Flodden. Among these are sprinkled
spread eagles, dragons, griffins, unicorns, and horses, black, white,
bay, and grey, with corresponding mares, and shoes enow for
them all. Boars, in every position and state of temper; bulls,
some crowned, some with rings in the nose, like our friend
"John" of that name. Foxes, too, and dogs, presenting their noses
with admirable directness of purpose at something in the next
street; and innocent-looking partridges, who appear reckless of
the intentions of the sanguinary wretch in green, who is erroneously
supposed to be <i>lurking</i> behind the bush, with a gun in
his hand. Talbots, falcons, hawks, hounds and huntsmen, the
latter sometimes in "full cry," but almost always considerably
"at fault," so far as perspective goes. Swans, black and white,
with any number of necks that can be reasonably expected; stags,
saints, saracens, jolly millers, boars' heads, blue bells, pack-horses,
lambs, rams, and trees of oak and yew. The seven stars, and,
now and then, a great bear. Lions, of all colours, conditions,
and positions&mdash;resting, romping, and running; with a number
of apocryphal animals, not explainable by any natural history
extant, nor to be found anywhere, I believe, except in the
swamps and jungles of some drunken dauber's brain. Also a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
"Jolly Waggoners," grinning extensively at foaming flagons of
ale, garnished with piles of bread and cheese, and onions as big
as cannon-balls, as if to outface the proportions of the Colossus
of Rhodes, who sits there in a state of stiff, everlasting, clumsy,
good-tempered readiness, in front of his never-dwindling feed,
Marlboroughs, Abercrombies, and Wellingtons; Duncans, Rodneys,
and Nelsons, by dozens. I have seen an admiral painted on
horseback, somewhere; but I never saw Cromwell on an alehouse
sign yet. In addition to these, there are a few dukes, mostly of
York and Clarence. Such signs as these show the old way of
living and thinking. But, in our manufacturing towns, the tone
of these old devices is considerably modified by an infusion of
railway hotels, commercials, cotton-trees, shuttles, spindles, woolpacks,
Bishop Blaizes, and "Old Looms;" and the arms of the
ancient feudal gentry are outnumbered by the arms of shepherds,
foresters, moulders, joiners, printers, bricklayers, painters, and
several kinds of odd-fellows. The old "Legs of Man," too,
are relieved by a comfortable sprinkling of legs and shoulders of
mutton&mdash;considerably overdone by the weather, in some cases.
Even alehouse signs are "signs of the times," if properly interpreted.
But both men and alehouse signs may make up their
minds to be misinterpreted a little in this world. Two country
lasses, at Rochdale, one fair-day, walking by the Roebuck Inn,
one of them, pointing to the gilded figure of the animal, with
its head uplifted to an overhanging bunch of gilded grapes, said,
"Sitho, sitho, Mary, at yon brass dog, heytin' brass marrables!"</p>

<p>About half-a-mile up the high road from Heybrook, and
opposite to Shaw House, the view opens, and we can look across
the fields on either side, into a country of green pastures and
meadows, varied with fantastic hillocks and dells, though bare of
trees. A short distance to the north-west, Buckley Hall lately
stood, on a green eminence in sight from the road. But the old
house of the Buckleys, of Buckley, recently disappeared from the
knoll where it stood for centuries. Its thick, bemossed walls are
gone, and all its quaint, abundant outhousing that stood about
the spacious, balder-paved yard behind. This old hall gave name
and residence to one of the most ancient families in Rochdale
parish. The building was low, but very strongly built of stone
of the district, and heavily timbered. It was not so large as
Clegg Hall, nor Stubley Hall, nor as some other old halls in the
parish; but, for its size, it proved a considerable quarry of stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
and flag when taken down. The first occupier was Geoffry de
Buckley, nephew to Geoffry, dean of Whalley, who lived in the
time of Henry the Second. A descendant of this Geoffry de
Buckley was slain in the battle of Evesham ("History of Whalley").
The name of John de Buckley appears among the monks of Stanlaw,
in the year 1296. The arms of the Buckleys, of Buckley,
are gules, a chevron sable; between three bulls' heads, armed
proper; crest, on a wreath, a bull's head armed proper. Motto,
"Nec temere nec timede." There is a chantry chapel at the
south-east corner of Rochdale parish church, "founded in 1487,
by Dr. Adam Marland, of Marland; Sir Randal Butterworth,
of Belfield; and Sir James Middleton, 'a brotherhood maide and
ordayned in the worship of the glorious Trinity, in the church
of Rochdale;' Sir James being appointed Trinity priest during
his lyfe; and, among other things, he was requested, when he
went to the lavoratory, standing at the altar, and, twice a week,
to pray for the co-founders, with 'De profundis.'" In this little
chantry, there is a recumbent stone effigy of a mailed warrior,
of the Buckley family, placed there by the present lord of the
manor, whose property the chapel is now. I know that some of
the country people who had been reared in the neighbourhood of
Buckley Hall, watched its demolition with grieved hearts. And
when the fine old hall at Radcliffe was taken down, not long
since, an aged man stood by, vigorously denouncing the destroyers
as the work went on, and glorying in every difficulty they met
with; and they were not few, for it was a tough old place.
"Poo," said he, "yo wastril devils, poo! Yo connut rive th'
owd hole deawn for th' heart on yo! Yo'n ha' to blow it up
wi' gunpeawdhur, bi'th mass. It wur noan bigged eawt o' club
brass, that wur not, yo shabby thieves! Tay th' pattern on't,
an' yo'n larn summat! What mak' o' trash wi'n yo stick up i'th
place on't, when it's gwon? Those wholes u'll bide leynin again,
better nor yors! Yo'n never big another heawse like that while
yo'n teeth an' e'en in yor yeds! Eh, never, never! Yo hannut
stuff to do it wi'!" But down came the old hall at Radcliffe;
and so did Buckley Hall, lately; and the materials were dressed
up to build the substantial row of modern cottages which now
stand upon the same site, with pleasant gardens in front, sloping
down the knoll, and over the spot where the old fish-pond was,
at the bottom. Some of the workpeople at the neighbouring
woollen mill find comfortable housing there now. There is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
old tradition, respecting the Buckley family, connected with a
massive iron ring which was found fastened in the flooring of
a deserted chamber of the hall. A greyhound, belonging to this
family, whilst in London with its master, took off homeward on
being startled by the fall of a heavy package, in Cheapside, and
was found dead on the door-step of Buckley Hall at five next
morning, after having run one hundred and ninety-six miles in
sixteen hours. When visiting relatives of mine near Buckley, I
met with a story relating to one of the Buckleys of old, who
was a dread to the country side; how he pursued a Rossendale
rider, who had crossed the moors from the forest, to recover a
stolen horse from the stables of Buckley Hall by night; and
how this Buckley, of Buckley, overtook and shot him, at a lonely
place called "Th' Hillock," between Buckley and Rooley Moor.
There are other floating oral traditions connected with Buckley
Hall, especially the tale of "The Gentle Shepherdess," embodying
the romantic adventures, and unfortunate fate of a lady belonging
to the family of Buckley, of Buckley. And in this wide parish
of Rochdale, in the eastern nook of Lancashire,&mdash;once a country
fertile in spots of lone and rural prettiness, and thinly inhabited
by as quaint, hearty, and primitive a people as any in England,&mdash;there
is many a picturesque and storied dell; some tales of historic
interest; and many an interesting legend connected with the
country, or with the old families of the parish;&mdash;the Byrons, of
Butterworth Hall, barons of Rochdale; the Entwisles, of Foxholes;
the Crossleys, of Scaitcliffe; the Holts, of Stubley, Grislehurst,
and Castleton; the Cleggs, of Clegg Hall, the scene of the tradition
of "Clegg Ho' Boggart;" the Buckleys, of Buckley; the
Marlands, of Marland; the Howards, of Great Howard; the
Chadwicks, of Chadwick Hall, and Healey Hall; the Bamfords,
of Bamford; the Schofields, of Schofield; the Butterworths; the
Belfields; and many other families of ancient note, often bearing
the names of their own estates, in the old way.</p>

<p>In this part of South Lancashire, the traveller never meets
any considerable extent of level land; and, though the county
contains great moors, and some mosses, yet there is not such
another expansive tract of level country to be found in it as
"Chat Moss," that lonely grave of old forests. South-east Lancashire
is all picturesque ups and downs, retired nooks, and
"quips, and cranks, and wanton wiles," and little winding vales,
with endless freaks of hill and hillock, knoll and dell, dingle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
and shady cleft, laced with numerous small streamlets, and clear
rindles of babbling water, up to the foot of that wilderness of
moorland hills, the "Back-bone of England," which runs across
the island, from Derbyshire into Scotland, and forms a considerable
part of Lancashire upon its way. The parish of Rochdale partly
consists of, and is bounded by, this tract of hills on the east and
north; and what may be called the lowland part of the parish
looks, when seen from some of the hills in the immediate neighbourhood,
something like a sea of tempest-tossed meadows and
pasture lands, upon which fleets of cotton mills ride at anchor,
their brick masts rising high into the air, and their streamers of
smoke waving in the wind.</p>

<p>Leaving the open part of the high road, opposite Shaw House,
and losing sight of Buckley, we began to rise as we passed through
Brickfield up to Smallbridge. This village is seated on an elevation,
sloping gently from the northern bank of the river Roch,
which rise continues slightly through the village, and up northward,
with many a dip and frolic by the way, till it reaches the
hills above Wardle Fold, where nature leaps up in a wild and
desolate mood. Some of the lonely heights thereabouts have
been beacon stations, in old times, and their names indicate
their ancient uses, as "Ward Hill," above the village of Wardle.
"Jack th' Huntsman" used to declare, vehemently, that Brown
Wardle Hill was "th' finest hunting-greawnd i' Lancashire."
And then there is "Tooter's Hill," "Hornblower's Hill," and
"Hade's Hill." From the summit of the last, the waters descend
on one side to the Irish Sea, on the west, on the other to the
German Ocean, on the east. The remains of a large beacon are
still visible on the top of it. Looking southward, from the edge
of Smallbridge, the dale lies green and fair in the hollow below,
and the silent Roch winds through it towards Rochdale town.
The view stretches out several miles beyond the opposite bank
of the river, over the romantic township of Butterworth, up
to the Saddleworth hills. Green and picturesque, a country of
dairy farms, producing matchless milk and butter; yet the soil is
evidently too cold and poor for the successful production of any
kind of grain, except the hardy oat&mdash;and that crop mostly thin
and light as an old man's hair. But even this extensive view
over a beautiful scene, in other respects, lacks the charm which
green woods lend to a landscape; for, except a few diminutive
tufts and scattered patches, where young plantations struggle up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
there are scarcely any trees. From Smallbridge, taking a south-east
direction, up by "Tunshill," "Dolderum," "Longden End,"
and "Booth Dean," and over the Stanedge road, into the ravines
of Saddleworth, would be a long flight for the crow; but to
anybody who had to foot the road thither, it would prove a
rougher piece of work than it looks. The village of Smallbridge
itself consists principally of one street, about half a mile long,
lining the high road from Rochdale to Littleborough. It will
have a dull, uninteresting look to a person who knows nothing,
previously, of the place, nor of the curious generation dwelling
thereabouts. Smallbridge has a plain, hard-working, unpolished,
every-day look. No wandering artist, in search of romantic bits
of village scenery, would halt enchanted with Smallbridge. It
has no architectural relic of the olden time in it, nor any remarkable
modern building&mdash;nothing which would tell a careless
eye that it had been the homestead of many generations of Lancashire
men. It consists, chiefly, of the brick-built cottages,
inhabited by weavers, colliers, and factory operatives, relieved
by the new Episcopalian church, at the eastern end, the little
pepper-box bell-turret of which peeps up over the houses, as if
to remind the rude inhabitants of something higher than bacon-collops
and ale. About half a mile up the road which leads out
of the centre of the village, northward, stands a plain-looking
stone mansion, apparently about one hundred and fifty years old,
called "Great Howarth." It stands upon a shapely knoll, the
site of an older hall of the same name, and has pleasant slopes
of green land about it, and a wide prospect over hill and dale.
Extensive alterations, in the course of the last hundred years, have
destroyed most of the evidences of this place's age and importance;
but its situation, and the ancient outbuildings behind, and the
fold of cottages nestling near to the western side of the hall, with
peeping bits of stone foundation, of much older date than the
building standing upon them; the old wells, and the hue of the
lands round about; all show that it has been a place of greater
note than it is at present. This great Howarth, or Howard, is
said to be the original settlement of the Howard family, the
present Dukes of Norfolk. Some people in the neighbourhood
also seem to believe this, for, as we entered Smallbridge, we
passed "The Norfolk Arms," a little public-house. One Osbert
Howard was rewarded by Henry I. ("Beauclerk") for his faithful
services, with lands situate in the township of Honorsfield, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Hundersfield, in the parish of Rochdale, also with what is called
"the dignified title of Master of the Buck Hounds." Robertus
Howard, Abbot of Stanlaw, was one of the four monks from
this parish, whose names appear among the list of the fraternity,
at the time of their translation to Whalley. He died on the
10th of May, 1304. Dugdale, in his "Baronage of England,"
says, respecting the Howards, Dukes of Norfolk:&mdash;"I do not
make any mention thereof above the time of King Edward the
First, some supposing that their common ancestor, in the Saxon's
time, took his original appellation from an eminent office or
command; others, afterwards, from the name of a place." ...
"I shall, therefore (after much fruitless search to satisfy myself,
as well as others, on this point) begin with William Howard, a
learned and reverend judge of the Court of Common Pleas, for a
great part of King Edward the First's and beginning of Edward
the Second's time." So that there seems to be a possibility of
truth in the assertion that Great Howard, or Howarth, near
Smallbridge, was the original settlement of the Howards, ancestors
of the Dukes of Norfolk. But I must leave the matter to
those who have better and completer evidence than this. Aiken,
in his "History of Manchester," mentions a direful pestilence,
which severely afflicted that town about the year 1645. A
pestilence called the "Black Plague" raged in the parish of
Rochdale about the same time. "The whole district being filled
with dismay, none dared, from the country, to approach the
town, for fear of catching the contagion; therefore, to remedy,
as much as possible, the inconvenience of non-intercourse between
the country and town's people, the proprietor of Great Howarth
directed a cross to be raised on a certain part of his estate, near
to Black Lane End, at Smallbridge, for the purpose of holding a
temporary market there, during the continuance of the plague."
Thence originated "Howarth Cross," so named to this day;
also, the old "Milk Stones," or "Plague Stones," lately standing
at about a mile's distance from the town of Rochdale, upon the
old roads. I well remember two of these, which were large,
heavy flag-stones, with one end imbedded in the edge side, and
the other end supported upon rude stone pillars. One of these
two was in "Milk Stone Lane," leading towards Oldham, and
the other at "Sparth," about a mile on the Manchester road.
This last of these old "Milk Stones," or "Plague Stones," was
recently taken down. I find that similar stones were erected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
in the outlets of Manchester, for the same purpose, during the
pestilence, about 1645. The village of Smallbridge itself, as I
have said before, has not much either of modern grace or antique
interest about its outward appearance. But, in the secluded folds
and corners of the country around, there is many a quaint farmstead
of the seventeenth century, or earlier, such as Waterhouse,
Ashbrook Hey, Howarth Knowl, Little Howarth, Dearnley,
Mabroyd, Wuerdle, Little Clegg, Clegg Hall (the haunt of the
famous "Clegg Ho' Boggart"). Wardle Fold, near Wardle Hall,
was fifty years since only a small sequestered cluster of rough
stone houses, at the foot of the moorland heights, on the north,
and about a mile from Smallbridge. It has thriven considerably
by manufacture since then. In some of these old settlements
there are houses where the door is still opened from without by
a "sneck-bant," or "finger-hole." Some of these old houses have
been little changed for two or three centuries; around others a
little modern addition has gathered in the course of time; but the
old way of living and thinking lingers in these remote corners
still, like little standing pools, left by the tide of ancient manners,
which has gone down, and is becoming matter of history or
of remembrance. There, and in the still more lonely detached
dwellings and folds, which are scattered among the hills and
cloughs of the "Edge," they cling to the speech, and ways,
and superstitions of their rude forefathers. A tribe of hardy,
industrious, old-fashioned, simple-hearted folk, whose principal
fear is poverty and "boggarts." They still gather round the fire,
in corners where factories have not yet reached them, in the
gray gloaming, and on dark nights in winter, to feed their imaginations
with scraps of old legend, and tales of boggarts, fairies,
and "feeorin," that haunt their native hills, and dells, and
streams; and they look forward with joy to the ancient festivals
of the year, as reliefs to their lonely round of toil. But Smallbridge
had other interests for us besides those arising out of its
remote surrounding nooks and population. We had known the
village ever since the time when a ramble so far out from Rochdale
seemed a great feat for tiny legs; and, as we passed each
well-remembered spot, the flood-gates of memory were thrown
open, and a whole tide of early reminiscences came flowing over
the mind:&mdash;</p>

<p>The inhabitants of different Lancashire towns and villages have
often some generic epithet attached to them, supposed to be expressive
of their character; as, for the inhabitants of Oldham
and Bolton, "Owdham Rough Yeds," and "Bowton Trotters;"
and the people of Smallbridge are known throughout the vale by
the name of "Smo'bridge Cossacks." Within the last twenty
years, the inhabitants of the village have increased in number,
and improved in education and manners. Before that time the
place was notable for its rugged people; even in a district generally
remarkable for an old-world breed of men and manners.
Their misdemeanours arose more from exuberant vigour of heart
and body, than from natural moral debasement. Twenty years
since there was no church in Smallbridge, no police to keep its
rude people in order&mdash;no effective school of any sort. The
weavers and colliers had the place almost to themselves in those
days. They worked hard, and ate and drank as much as their
earnings would afford, especially on holidays, or "red-letter days;"
and, at by-times, they clustered together in their cottages, but
oftener at the road-side, or in some favourite alehouse, and
solaced their fatigue with such scraps of news and politics as
reached them; or by pithy, idiomatic bursts of country humour,
and old songs. Sometimes these were choice snatches of the
ballads of Britain, really beautiful "minstrel memories of times
gone by;" such as we seldom hear now, and still seldomer hear
sung with the feeling and natural taste which the country lasses
of Lancashire put into them, while chanting at their work.
Some of Burns's songs, and many songs commemorating the
wars of England, were great favourites with them. Passing
by a country alehouse, one would often hear a rude ditty, like
the following, sounding loud and clear from the inside:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You generals all, and champions bold,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Who take delight i'th field;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who knock down palaces and castle walls,</span><br />
<span class="i2">And never like to yield;</span><br />
<span class="i0">I am an Englishman by birth,</span><br />
<span class="i2">And Marlbro' is my name;</span><br />
<span class="i0">In Devonshire I first drew breath,</span><br />
<span class="i2">That place of noble fame.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>Or this finishing couplet of another old ballad:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To hear the drums and the trumpets sound,</span><br />
<span class="i2">In the wars of High Garmanie!</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>I well remember that the following were among their favourites:&mdash;"O,
Nanny, wilt thou gang wi' me?" "Jockey to the Fair,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
"Owd Towler," "The Banks of the Dee," "Black Eyed Susan,"
"Highland Mary," "The Dawning of the Day," "The Garden
Gate," and "The Woodpecker." There are, also, a few rough,
humorous songs in the Lancashire dialect, which are very common
among them. The best of these is the rudely-characteristic ballad
called "Jone o' Greenfelt," and "The Songs of the Wilsons," of
which the following, known by the name of "Johnny Green's
Wedding," and "Description of Manchester College," by Alexander
Wilson, is sufficient to show the manner and characteristics
of the remainder of these popular local songs:&mdash;</p>

<p>When the horn sounded to gather the harriers, or the "foomart
dogs," the weaver lads used to let go their "pickin'-pegs," roll up
their aprons, and follow the chase afoot, with all the keen relish
of their forefathers, returning hungry, tired, and pleased at night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
to relate the adventures of the day. Sometimes they sallied from
the village, in jovial companies, attended by one or more of their
companions, to have a drinking-bout, and challenge "th' cocks o'
th' clod" in some neighbouring hamlet. Such expeditions often
led to a series of single combats, in which rude bodily strength
and pluck were the principal elements of success; sometimes
a general <i>melée</i>, or "Welsh main," took place; often ending in
painful journeys, with broken bones, over the moors, to the
"Whitworth Doctors." As far as rough sports and rough
manners went, "the dule" seemed to have "thrut his club" over
Smallbridge in those days. That man was lucky who could
walk through the village without being assailed by something
more inconvenient than mere looks of ignorant wonder, and a
pelting of coarse jokes; especially if he happened to wear the
appearance of a "teawn's buck." They had a kind of contempt
for "teawn's folk," as an inferior race, especially in body. If
town's people had more intelligence than was common in the
country, these villagers often affected to consider it a knavish
cleverness; and if they seemed externally clean, they looked upon
it as an hypocritical concealment of the filth beneath. If they
were well dressed, the old doubt arose, as to its being "o' paid
for;" and if one appeared among them who had no settled home
or connections, and whose demeanour they did not like, he had
"done summat wrang somewheer, or elze he'd ne'er ha' bin o'
that shap." In fact, it was hardly possible for people bred in a
town to be as clean, strong, or honest, as those bred in the
country. Town's folk had nothing wholesome about them;
they were "o' offal an' boylin-pieces." When they visited
Manchester, or any of the great towns about, they generally
took a supply of eatables with them for the journey; "coud
frog-i'-th'-hole puddin," or "fayberry cake," or "sodden moufin
an' cheese," or such like homely buttery-stuff; for if they had
occasion to enter any strange house in such places, to satisfy their
hunger, every mouthful went down among painful speculations
as to what the quadruped was when alive, and what particular
reason it had for departing this life. Burns alludes affectionately
to "the halesome parritch, chief o' Scotia's food;" and oatmeal
porridge, and oat-cake, enter largely into the diet of the country
people in this part of Lancashire. They used to pride themselves
in the name of "the Havercake Lads." A regiment raised in
Lancashire during the last war bore this name. This oat-cake is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
baked upon a peculiar kind of stone slab, called a "back-stone;"
and the cry of "Havercake back-stones" is a familiar sound in
Rochdale, and the villages around it, at this day. Oatmeal
porridge forms an important element of a genuine Lancashire
breakfast in the country. I have often noticed the air of satisfaction
with which a Lancashire housewife has filled up the great
breakfast bowl with hot oatmeal porridge, and, clapping the pan
on the floor, said, "Theer, lads, pultiz yo'r stomachs wi'
thoose!" And the hungry, hearty youngsters have gathered
hastily round their old dish, welcoming it with the joyous
ejaculation of "That's th' mak'!" The thick unleavened oat-cake,
called "Jannock," is scarcely ever seen in South-east
Lancashire now; but it used to be highly esteemed. The common
expression, "That's noan jannock," applied to anything
which is not what it ought to be, commemorates the fame of
this wholesome old cake of theirs. But they have no inclination
to an exclusively vegetarian diet; in fact, they generally express
a decided relish for "summat at's deed ov a knife;" and, like
their ancient progenitors, the Saxons, they prefer heavy meals,
and long draughts, to any kind of light epicurean nicety.</p>

<p>There are many old prejudices still cherished by the country
people of south-east Lancashire,&mdash;as is their old belief in witches,
witch-doctors, and "Planet-rulers;"&mdash;but they are declining,
through increasing communion with the rest of the world. And
then these things show only the unfavourable side of their character;
for they are hospitable, open-handed, frank, and benevolent by
nature. How oft have I seen them defend the downcast and the
stranger; or shut up ungenerous suspicions, and open all the
sluices of their native kindness by the simple expression, "He's
somebody's chylt!""</p>

<p>"Owd Roddle" is a broken-down village fuddler in Smallbridge;
perpetually racking his brains about "another gill." His appearance
is more that of an Indian Fakeer than an English country
gentleman. He is as "concayted as a whisket" in some things,
but not in eating or drinking; for he will "seawk lamp-hoyle
through a bacco-pipe if onybody'll give him a droight o' ale to
wesh it deawn wi'; an' as for heytin', he'll heyt mortal thing&mdash;deeod
or alive&mdash;if he con get his teeth into't." A native of
Smallbridge was asked, lately, what "Roddle" did for his living,
and he replied, "Whaw, he wheels coals, and trails abeawt wi'
his clogs loce, an' may's a foo' of his-sel' for ale." Yet, utterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
lost as Roddle is himself in person and habits, he is strongly
imbued with the old prejudices against town's folk. To him, the
whitest linen worn by a townsman, is only what the country folk
call a "French white." A well-dressed person from Rochdale
chanced one day to awaken "Roddle's" ire, who, eyeing him
from head to foot, with a critical sneer, said, "Shap off whoam,
as fast as tho con, an' get tat buff shurt sceawr't a bit, wilto;
an' thy skin an' o; for theawr't wick wi' varmin; an' keep o'
thy own clod, whol tho con turn eawt some bit like." "But,"
continued my informant, "aw'm a bit partial to th' offal crayter,
for o' that; he's so mich gam in him, and aw like a foo i' my
heart! Eh! he used to be as limber as a treawt when he're
young; but neaw he's as wambly an' slamp as a barrow full o'
warp-sizin'. Th' tother mornin' aw walked up to him for a bit
ov a crack, as uzal, but th' owd lad had getten his toppin cut off
close to his yed; an' he wacker't an' stare't like a twichelt dog;
an' he gran at mo like mad. Aw're forc't dray back a bit, at th'
first, he glooart so flaysome. It're very frosty, an' his een looked
white and wild; an' as geawl't as a whelp. If the dule had met
Roddle at th' turn of a lone that mornin' he'd a skriked hissel'
eawt ov his wits, an' gwon deawn again. Eawr measther sauces
me sometimes for talkin' to Roddle; but aw olez tell him at
aw'st have a wort wi' th' poor owd twod when aw meet him,
as what onybody says."</p>

<p>There is a race of hereditary sand-sellers, or "sond-knockers,"
in Smallbridge; a rough, mountaineer breed, who live by crushing
sandstone rock, for sale in the town of Rochdale, and the villages
about it. This sand is used for strewing upon the flagged
house floors, when the floor is clean washed; and while it is
yet damp, the sand is ground over it by the motion of a heavy
"scouring-stone," to which a long, strong, wooden handle is
firmly fixed, by being fastened to an iron claw, which grasps the
stone, and is embedded into it by molten lead. The motion of
the "scouring-stone" works the flags into smoothness, and leaves
an ornamental whiteness on the floor when it gets dry; it breeds
dust, however, and much needless labour. The people who
knock this sand and sell it, have been known over the country
side for many years by the name of "Th' Kitters;" and the
common local proverb, "We're o' of a litter, like Kitter pigs," is
used in Smallbridge, as an expression of friendship or of kinship.
As regular as Saturday morning came, the sand-carts used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
come into Rochdale, heavily laden; and I remember that they
were often drawn by horses which, like the steed of the crazy
gentleman of Spain, were "many-cornered;" and, often, afflicted
by some of the more serious ills which horse-flesh is heir to.
They have better horses now, I believe, and they are better
used. The train of attendants which usually accompanied these
sand-carts into the town was of a curious description. Hardy,
bull-necked, brown-faced drivers, generally dressed in strong
fustian, which, if heavily plated with patches in particular
quarters, was still mostly whole, but almost always well mauled,
and soiled with the blended stains of sand, and spilt ale, and
bacon fat, with clumsily-stiched rips visible here and there: the
whole being a kind of tapestried chronicle of the wearer's way of
living, his work, his fights, fuddles, and feasts. Then they were
often bare-headed, with their breeches ties flowing loose at the
knees, and the shirt neck wide open, displaying a broad, hairy,
weather-beaten chest; and the jovial-faced, Dutch-built women,
too, in blue lin aprons, blue woollen bedgowns, and clinkered
shoon; and with round, wooden, peck and half-peck measures
tucked under their arms, ready for "hawpoths" and "pennoths."
As the cart went slowly along, the women went from house to
house, on each side of the road, and, laying one hand upon the
door cheek, looked in with the old familiar question, "Dun yo
want ony sond this mornin'?" "Ay; yo may lev a hawputh.
Put it i' this can." When they came to an old customer and
acquaintance, sometimes a short conversation would follow, in a
strain such as this: "Well, an heaw are yo, owd craythur?"
"Whaw, aw'm noan as aw should be by a deeol. Aw can heyt
nought, mon, an' aw connut tay my wynt." "Aw dunnot
wonder at tat; yo'n so mich reech abeawt here. If yo'rn up at
th' Smo'bridge, yo'dd'n be fit to heyt yirth-bobs an' scaplins,
welly. Mon, th' wynt's clen up theer, an' there's plenty on't,
an' wi can help irsels to't when we like'n. Wi'n yo come up o'
seein' us?" "Eh, never name it! Aw's ne'er get eawt o' this
hole till aw'm carried eawt th' feet formost!" "Come, wi'n
ha' noan o' that mak o' talk! Aw'd as lief as a keaw-price at
yo'dd'n come. Yo'n be welcome to th' best wi han, an wi'n
may yo comfortable beside; an' bring yo deawn again i'th cart.
But ir Jem's gwon forrud wi' th' sond. Let's see; did'n yo gi'
mo th' hawp'ny?... Oh, ay! It'll be reet! Neaw tay care
o' yorsel', and keep yo'r heart eawt o' yo'r clogs!" When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
cart came to a rut or a rise in the road, all hands were summoned
to the push, except one who tugged and thumped at the horse,
and another who seized the spokes of the wheel, and, with set
teeth and strained limbs, lent his aid to the "party of progress"
in that way. Sometimes a sturdy skulker would follow the cart,
to help to push, and to serve out sand; but more for a share of
the fun, and the pile of boiled brisket and cheese an' moufin,
stowed away in the cart-box at starting, to be washed down
with "bally-droights" of cold fourpenny at some favourite "co'in-shop"
on the road.</p>

<p>The old custom of distinguishing persons by Christian names
alone, prevails generally in Smallbridge, as in all country parts
of Lancashire, more or less. It sometimes happens, in small
country villages like this, that there are people almost unknown,
even among their own neighbours, by their surnames. Roby
gives an instance of this kind in his "Traditions of Lancashire,"
where he mentions a woman, then living in the village of Whitworth,
for whom it would be useless to inquire there by her
proper name; but anybody in the village could have instantly
directed you to "Susy o' Yem's o' Fairoff's, at th' top o' th'
Rake," by which name she was intimately known. Individuals
are often met whose surnames have almost dropt into oblivion
by disuse, and who have been principally distinguished through
life by the name of their residence, or some epithet descriptive of
a remarkable personal peculiarity, or some notable incident in
their lives. Such names as the following, which will be recognised
in their locality, are constantly met, and the list of them
might be extended to any desirable degree:&mdash;"Tum o' Charles
o' Billy's," or "Red Tum," "Bridfuut," "Corker," "Owd
Fourpenny," "Tum o' Meawlo's," "Rantipow," and "Ab o'
Pinder's," who fought a battle in the middle of the river Roch,
at a great bull-bait in Rochdale, more than thirty years ago;
"Bull Robin," "Jone o' Muzden's," "Owd Moreover," and
"Bonny Meawth." This last reminds me of the report of a
young villager, near Smallbridge, respecting the size of the
people's mouths in a neighbouring district. "Thi'n th' bigg'st
meawths i' yon country," said he, "at ever I seed clapt under a

o' reawnd; but he knockt mo into th' slutch." Many of these
quaint names rise in my memory as I write: "Owd Dragon,"
"Paul o' Bill's," "Plunge," "Ben o' Robin's o' Bob's o' th'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Bird-stuffers, o' Buersil Yed," "Collop," "Tolloll," "Pratty
Strider," "Lither Dick," and "Reawnt Legs,"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Reawnt Legs he wur a cunnin' owd twod,</span><br />
<span class="i0">He made a mule draw a four-horse lwod.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>And then there was "Johnny Baa Lamb," a noted character in
Rochdale twelve years ago. He was low in stature, rather
stout, and very knock-knee'd; and his face was one paradise of
never-fading ale-blossoms. Johnny's life was spent in helping
about the slaughter-houses, and roaming from alehouse to alehouse,
where, between his comical appearance, his drunken
humour, his imitations of the tones of sheep, lambs, and other
animals, and his old song,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">The mon and the mare,</span><br />
<span class="i6">Flew up in the air,</span><br />
<span class="i0">An' I think I see 'em yet, yet, yet;&mdash;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>the chorus of which he assisted by clattering a poker on the
hearth, he was a general favourite, and kept himself afloat in
ale&mdash;the staple of his ambition&mdash;by being the butt of every
tap-room, where his memory remains embarmed. There was
"Barfuut Sam," a carter, who never would wear any foot-gear;
"Ab o' Slender's," "Broth," "Steeom," "Scutcher," "Peawch,"
and "Dick-in-a-Minnit." Most of these were as well known
as the church clock. And then there was "Daunt o' Peggy's,"
"Brunner," "Shin 'em," "Ayli o' Joe's o' Bet's o' Owd Bullfuut's,"
and "Fidler Bill," who is mentioned in the Lancashire song,
"Hopper hop't eawt, an' Limper limp't in,"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then aw went to th' Peel's Arms to taste of their ale;</span><br />

</div></div>

<p>and then there was "Jone o' Isaac's," the mower; "Peyswad,"
and "Bedflock," who sowed blend-spice in his garden for parsley
seed; and "Owd Tet, i' Crook," an amiable and aged country
woman, who lived in a remote corner of the moors, above
Smallbridge, and whose intended husband dying when she was
very young, she took it deeply to heart. On being pressed to
accept the hand of a neighbour, who knew her excellent qualities,
she at last consented, assuring him, however, that her heart was
gone, and all that she could promise him was that she could
"spin an' be gradely;" which saying has become a local proverb.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
In the forest of Rosendale, I have met with a few names of
more curious structure than even any of the previous ones, such
as "Eb o' Peg's o' Puddin' Jane's," "Bet o' Owd Harry's o'
Nathan's at th' Change," "Enoch o' Jem's o' Rutchot's up at th'
Nook," "Harry o' Mon John's," "Ormerod o' Jem's o' Bob's,"
and "Henry o' Ann's o' Harry's o' Milley's o' Ruchots o' John's
o' Dick's, through th' ginnel, an' up th' steps, an' o'er Joseph's
o' John's o' Steen's," which rather extraordinary cognomen was
given to me by a gentleman, living near Newchurch, as authentic,
and well known in a neighbouring dale. In a village near Bolton,
there was, a few years since, a letter-carrier who had so long
been known by a nickname, that he had almost forgotten his
proper name. By an uncommon chance, however, he once
received a letter directed to himself, but not remembering the
owner, or anybody of that name, he carried the letter in his
pocket for several days, till he happened to meet with a shrewd
old villager, whom his neighbours looked upon as "larn't up,"
and able to explain everything&mdash;from ale, bull-dogs, and politics,
to the geography of the moon and the mysteries of theology.
The postman showed his letter to this Delphic villager, inquiring
whether he knew anybody of that name. The old man looked
an instant, then, giving the other a thump, he said, "Thea foo',
it's thisel'!" I have heard of many an instance, in different
parts of Lancashire, where some generic "John Smith," after
being sought for in vain for a while, has been at last discovered
concealed under some such guise as "Iron Jack," "Plunge,"
"Nukkin," or "Bumper." I remember an old religious student,
in Rochdale, who used to take considerable pains in drilling poor
lads into a knowledge of the Holy Scriptures. The early part
of the Bible was his favourite theme; and he interlarded his
conversation with it to such a degree, that he won for himself
the distinguished title of "Th' Five Books o' Moses."</p>

<p>In Collier's tale of "Tummus and Meary," he illustrates the
personal nomenclature of these parts, in his own time, by the
following passage, which, though it may appear strange in the
eyes of people dwelling in the great cities of the south of England,
yet does not exaggerate the custom at present prevailing in the
remoter parts of the county of Lancaster:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Meary.</i> True, Tummus; no marvel at o' wur so flayed; it wur so fearfo dark.</p>

<p><i>Tummus.</i> Heawe'er, aw resolv't mayth best on't, an up speek aw.&mdash;"Woooas
tat?" A lad's voyce answer't in a cryin' din, "Eh, law; dunnah tay meh." "Naw,"
said aw, "aw'll na tay tho, belady! Whooaslad art to?" "Whau," said he, "aw'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
Jone o' Lall's o' Simmy's, o'Mariom's o' Dick's o' Nathan's, o' Lall's, o' Simmy's
i'th Hooms: an' aw'm gooin' whoam." "Odd," thinks aw t' mysel', "theaw's a
dree-er name ti'n me." An' here, Meary, aw couldn't boh think what lung names
some on us han; for thine and mine are meeterly; boh this lad's wur so mich
dree-er, 'at aw thowt it dockt mine tone hawve.</p>

<p><i>Meary.</i> Preo, na; tell meh ha these lung names leet'n.</p>

<p><i>Tummus.</i> Um&mdash;m; lemme see. Aw conno tell tho greadly; boh aw think it's
to tell folk by.</p>

<p><i>Meary.</i> Well, an' hea did'n he go on with him?</p>

<p><i>Tummus.</i> Then (as aw thowt he talkt so awkertly) aw'd ash him, for th' wonst,
what uncuths he yerd sturrin'. "Aw yer noan," said he, "but 'at Jack o' Ned's
towd mo, 'at Sam o' Jack's o' Yed's Marler has wed Mall o' Nan's o' Sal's o' Peg's,
'at gos abeawt o' beggin' churn milk, with a pitcher, with a lid on." Then aw asht
him wheer Jack o' Ned's wooant. Says he, "He's 'prentice weh Isaac o' Tim's o'
Nick's o'th Hough-lone, an' he'd bin at Jammy's o' George's o' Peter's i'th Dingles,
for hawve a peawnd o' traycle, to seaws'n a beest-puddin' weh; an' his feyther an'
moother wooan at Rossenda; boh his gronny's alive, an' wooans weh his noant
Margery, eh Grinfilt, at pleck wheer his noan moother coom fro'." "Good lad,"
says aw, "boh heaw far's tis <i>Littlebrough</i> off, for aw aim't see it to-neet iv he con
hit." Says t' lad, "It's abeawt a mile; an' yo mun keep straight forrud o' yor lift
hont, an yoan happen do." So a-this'n we parted; boh aw mawkint, an' lost my
gate again, snap.</p></blockquote>

<p>A curious instance of the prevalence of nicknames in this district
occurred, a few years since, about a mile from Smallbridge.
A country lass had got married out of a certain fold in that part,
and going down to Rochdale soon after, a female acquaintance
said to her, "Whau, Sally, thea's getten wed, hasn't to?"
"Yigh," said Sally, "aw have." "Well, an' what's te felly
code?" replied the other. "Whau," said Sally, "some folk co's
him 'Jone o' Nancy's lad, at th' Pleawm Heawse;' but his
gradely name's 'Clog Bant.'" We sometimes hear of a son
who bears the same christian name as his father, as "Jamie o'
James's," and "Sol ov Owd Sol's o' th' Hout Broo;" and I have
often heard a witless nursery rhyme, which runs,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Owd Tum an' yung Tum,</span><br />
<span class="i2">An' Owd Tum's son;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Yung Tum'll be a Tum</span><br />
<span class="i2">When Owd Tum's done;</span>
</div></div>

<p>but the poor people of Lancashire sometimes have a superstitious
fear of giving the son the same christian name as the father.</p>

<p>The ancient rural festival of "Rushbearing," in the month
of August, used to make a great stir in Smallbridge; but the
observance of it seems to decline, or, at least, assumes a soberer
form. A great number of local proverbs, and quaint sayings,
are continually being thrown up by the population there, which,
in spite of their rude garb, show, like nuggets of mental gold,
what undeveloped riches lie hidden in the human mind, even in
Smallbridge. The people are wonderfully apt at the discernment
and at the delineation of character. It is very common for
them to utter graphic sentences like the following:&mdash;"He's one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
o' thoose at'll lend onybody a shillin', iv they'n give him
fourteen-pence to stick to." One of them said, on receiving
a present of game from his son in Yorkshire, "It isn't oft
at th' kittlin' brings th' owd cat a meawse, but it has done
this time." There are two or three out of a whole troop of
anecdotes, told of the natives of this quarter, which have the air
of nature about them sufficiently to indicate what some of the
characteristics of these villagers were in past years. Two young
men were slowly taking their road, late one night, out at the
town end, after the fair, when one of them lingering behind the
other, his comrade shouted to him to "Come on!" "Stop an'
rosin," said the loiterer, "aw hannut foughten yet!" "Well,"
replied the other, with cool indifference, "Get foughten, an' let's
go whoam?" In the Rev. W. Gaskell's lectures on the Lancashire
dialect, he says, "The following dialogue is reported to have
taken place between two individuals on meeting:&mdash;'Han yo bin
to Bowton?' 'Yigh.' 'Han yo foughten?' 'Yigh.' 'Han
yo lickt'n?' 'Yigh; an' aw browten a bit'n him whoam i' my
pocket!'" "Owd Bun" was a collier, and a comical country
blade, dwelling near Smallbridge. He was illiterate, and rough
as a hedgehog. Bun had often heard of cucumbers, but had
never tasted one. Out of curiosity he bought a large one, curved
like a scimitar; and, reckless of all culinary guidance, he cut it
into slices lengthwise, and then fried the cold green slabs, all
together, in bacon fat. He ate his fill of them, too; for
nothing which mortal stomach would hold came amiss to Bun.
When he had finished, and wiped the grease from his mouth
with the back of his hand, he said, "By th' mon, fine folk'll
heyt aught! Aw'd sanur ha' had a potito!" They tell a tale,
too, of the difficulties of a poor factory lass who had been newly
married; which is not without its hints. Her husband told her
to boil him some eggs, and to "boyle 'em soft." He went out
awhile, and on his return, they were boiling, but not ready. He
waited long, and then shouted, "Are thoose eggs noan ready yet?"
"Naw," said she, "they are nut; for, sitho, aw've boyled 'em
aboon an heawur, an' they're no softer yet." Now he did not
care much for this; but when he saw her take the child's
nightcap off its head to boil his dumpling in, he declared that
"he couldn't ston it."</p>

<p>Leaving Smallbridge, we rattled out at the end of the village,
past the Red Lion, and up to the top of the slope, where, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
a run of about two hundred yards, we descended into the hollow
where the sign of the old "Green Gate" stands. In the season
of the year, people passing that way in a morning will often see
the door-way crowded with hunting dogs, and a rout of sturdy
rabble, waiting to follow the chase, afoot, through the neighbouring
hills. Rising again immediately, we crossed another
knoll, and down again we came to the foot of the brow, where
four roads meet, close by the "Green Mon Inn," opposite
to the deserted hamlet of Wuerdale, which perches, with
distressed look, upon a little ridge near the roadside, like an old
beggar craving charity. On we went, enjoying the romantic
variety of the scene, as the green ups and downs of the valley
opened out to view, with its scattered farms and mills, all clipt
in by the hills, which began to cluster near.</p>

<p>About half a mile further on, where the road begins to slant
suddenly towards Featherstall, Stubley Hall stands, not more
than twenty yards from the roadside. A much older hall than
the present one must have stood here prior to the 13th century,
for in 1322, and 1323, mention is made of Nicholas and John
de Stubley (His. Whalley). It subsequently came into the possession
of the Holt family, of Grislehurst and Castleton; a branch
of the Holts, of Sale, Ashton, Cheshire. Some of this family
fought in the Scottish wars, and also, in favour of the royal cause,
at Edgehill, Newbury, Marston Moor, &amp;c., and were named in
Charles's projected order of the Royal Oak. There was a Judge
Holt, of the Holts of Sale; and a James Holt, whose mother
was co-heiress to Sir James de Sutton; he was killed on Flodden
Field. Mary, the daughter of James Holt, the last of the family
who resided at Castleton, in this parish, married Samuel, brother
of the famous Humphrey Cheetham. The Castleton estate came
into Humphrey's hands in 1744. The manor of Spotland was
granted by Henry VIII. to Thomas Holt, who was knighted in
Scotland by Edward, Earl of Hertford, in the thirty-sixth year
of the reign of that king. The Holts were the principal landowners
in the parish of Rochdale at the close of the sixteenth
century. John Holt held the manor of Spotland, with its appurtenances;
also fourscore messuages, three mills, one thousand
acres of inclosed land, three hundred acres of meadow, one thousand
acres of pasture, and forty acres of woods, in Hundersfield,
Spotland, and Butterworth; besides a claim to hold of his majesty,
as of his duchy of Lancaster, one third of the manor of Rochdale.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
The arms of the Holts are described as "Argent on a band
engrailed sable, three fleur-de-lys of the first. Crest, a spear head
proper. Motto, 'Ut sanem vulnera.'" The present hall at
Stubley was built by Robert Holt, about the year 1528. Dr.
Whittaker notices this house, which is of considerable size,
forming three sides of a square. It is now inhabited by several
families; and much of the rich old carved oak, and other relics
of its former importance, have been removed from the interior.</p>

<p>From the top of the slope near Stubley, we now saw the spire
of Litteborough church, and the village itself, prettily situated at
the head of the vale, and close to the foot of the hills which divide
Lancashire and Yorkshire. On the top of Blackstone, and about
half a mile to the south of "Joe Faulkner's,"&mdash;the well-known old
sheltering spot for travellers over that bleak region,&mdash;we could
now more distinctly see the streak of green which marks the line
of the Roman road till it disappears from the summit of the Edge.</p>

<p>Featherstall is a little hamlet of comfortable cottages at the
bottom of the brow in the high road near Stubley Hall, warmed
by the "Rising Sun," and another, an old-fashioned public-house,
apparently as old as the present Stubley Hall. The inhabitants
are principally employed at the mills and collieries in the neighbourhood.
The open space in the centre of the village is
generally strewn with scattered hay, and the lights from the
public-houses gleam forth into the watering troughs in front,
as the traveller goes through at night. A rough old road leads out
of the centre of the place, northward, over Calder Moor and the
hills, towards Todmorden. From Featherstall, the approach to
Litteborough is lined with mills, meadows, and tenter-fields, on
the north side; and on the south, two or three green fields
divide the highway from the railway, and a few yards on the other
side of the railway the line of the Rochdale canal runs parallel with
both. And thus these three roads run nearly close together past
Litteborough, and all through the vale of Todmorden, up to
Sowerby Bridge, a distance of twelve miles; and, for a considerable
part of the way, the river forms a fourth companion to the three
roads, the four together filling the entire bottom of the valley
in some places; and, in addition to that, may be seen, in other
parts, the old pack-horse roads leading down from the moorland
steeps into the hollow. Carts, boats, railway trains, and sometimes
pack-horses, seem to comment upon one another as they
pass and re-pass, and form a continual and palpable lecture on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
modes of transit, such as is not often met with in such distinct
shape. Littleborough consists, principally, of one irregular street,
winding over a slight elevation, and down to its centre near the
railway station, at the water-side, and thence across the bridge,
up towards Blackstone Edge. It is a substantial, healthy-looking
village, prettily situated in a romantic spot. There are many poor
working people in the village, but there is hardly anything like
dirt or squalor to be seen there, except, perhaps, a little of that
migratory kind which is unavoidable in all great thoroughfares,
and which remains here for a night, on its way, at a roadside receptacle
which I noticed at the western end of the village, where
I saw on a little board certain ominous hieroglyphics about
"Loggins for travlurs." The lands in the valley round Littleborough
have the appearance of fine meadow and pasture; and,
taken with the still better cultivated grounds, and woods and
gardens, about the mansions of the opulent people of the
neighbourhood, the whole looks beautifully verdant, compared
with the bleak hills which overlook the vale. The old
Royal Oak Inn, in the middle of the village, is pointed
out as a house which John Collier used to frequent, when he
visited the neighbourhood, and where he fixed the scene of
Tummus's misadventure in the inn, where he so unadvisedly
"Eet like a Yorsharmon, and clear't th' stoo," after he had been
to the justice with his dog, "Nip," and where the encounter
took place between "Mezzilt Face" and "Wythen Kibbo:"&mdash;</p>

<p>This house used to be a great resort on Saturday nights, and fair
days, and holidays, and it was often crammed with the villagers
and their neighbours from the surrounding hill-sides; and no small
addition from Rochdale and Todmorden. The windows were
generally thrown open at such times; and, standing at some distance
from the place, one might perhaps be able, in some degree,
to sort the roar of wassailry going on inside. But if he wished to
know what were the component parts of the wild medley of melodies,
all gushing out from the house in one tremendous discord, he
would have to draw under the windows, where he might hear:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Our hounds they were staunch, and our horses were good</span><br />
<span class="i0">As ever broke cover, or dashed in a wood;</span><br />
<span class="i6">Tally-ho! hark forward, huzza; tally-ho!</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>Whilst, in another corner of the same room, a knot of strong-lunged
roysterers joined, at the top of their voices, in the
following chorus, beating time to it with fists and feet, and
anything else which was heavy and handy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Then heigho, heigho!</span><br />
<span class="i6">Sing heigho," cried he;</span><br />
<span class="i0">"Does my wife's first husband remember me?"</span><br />
<span class="i8">Fal de ral, de ral, de ral, de rido!</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>In another room he would probably hear "Boyne Water"
trolled out in a loud voice:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The horse were the first that ventured o'er;</span><br />
<span class="i2">The foot soon followed after:</span><br />
<span class="i0">But brave Duke Schomberg was no more,</span><br />
<span class="i2">At the crossing o' Boyne water.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>Whilst another musical tippler, in an opposite corner, sang, for
his own special amusement, the following quaint fragment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Owd shoon an' stockin's!</span><br />
<span class="i0">An' slippers at's made o' red leather!</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>In another quarter you might hear the fiddle playing the
animated strains of the "Liverpool Hornpipe," or "The Devil
rove his Shurt," while a lot of hearty youngsters, in wooden
clogs, battered the hearthstone to the tune. In a large room
above, the lights flared in the wind, as the lads and lasses flitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
to and fro in the "Haymaker," "Sir Roger de Coverley," or
"The Triumph;" or threaded through a reel, and set till the
whole house shook; whilst from other parts of the place you
would be sure to hear, louder than all else, the clatter of pots,
and hunting-cries; the thundering hurly-burly of drunken anger,
or the crash of furniture, mingling with the boisterous tones of
drunken fun. Whoever entered this house at such a time, in the
hope of finding a quiet corner, where he could be still, and look
round upon the curious mixture of quaint, rough character,
would very likely find that he had planted himself in the retreat
chosen by a drunken, maudlin fellow, who, with one eye closed,
sat uttering, by fits, noisy salutations of affection to the pitcher of
ale before him; or, with one leg over the other, his arms folded,

<p>Littleborough is the last village the traveller leaves on the
Lancashire side of the "Edge;" and the old high road from
Manchester to Leeds passes over the top of these moorland hills,
gently ascending all the way from Littleborough, by a circuitous
route, to the summit&mdash;nearly three miles. A substantial hostelrie
stands upon the brow of the hill, called "The White House,"
and sometimes "Joe Faulkner's," from the name of an eccentric
landlord who kept the house in the old coaching time. This
house can be seen from the valleys on the Lancashire side for
many miles. It was a celebrated baiting-place for the great
stream of travellers which went over these hills, before the railway
drew it through the vale of Todmorden. The division
stone of the counties of York and Lancaster stands about half a
mile beyond this old inn. Littleborough itself is prettily situated
in the hollow of the valley, at the foot of this wild range of
mountains, and at the entrance of the Todmorden valley. It is
surrounded by scenery which is often highly picturesque. Dark
moorlands, lofty and lonesome; woody cloughs; and green valleys,
full of busy life; with picturesque lakes, and little streams
which tumble from the hills. The village has many advantages
of situation, both for pleasure and manufacture. Stone and coal,
and good water, are abundant all around it; and it is fast thriving
by the increase of woollen and cotton manufacture. It is still a
great thoroughfare for Lancashire and Yorkshire; and a favourite
resort for botanists, geologists, sportsmen, and, not unfrequently,
invalids. Northward from the village, there are many romantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
cloughs, but, perhaps, the finest of these is the one called "Long
Clough," at the head of which is a remarkably fine spring, called
"Blue Pots Spring." The artificial lake of "Hollingworth" is
about half a mile from the village, on the south side; and there is
a beautiful walk leading up to its bank, through the shady clough
called "Cleggswood." This lake, when full, is three miles round.
It supplies the Rochdale canal, and is well stocked with fish.
Its elevation places it far above the bustle of the valley below,
where the highways and byeways, the iron-ways and water-ways,
interweaving thickly about the scene, are alive with the traffic of
the district. The valley is throng with the river, the railway,
the canal, and excellent high roads; and a hardy and industrious
population, which finds abundant employment at the woollen and
cotton mills, in the coal mines and stone delphs, or on the dairy
and sheep farms of this border region of South Lancashire. The
shelvy banks of "Hollingworth" consist of irregular tiers and
slopes of pasture, meadow, and moor lands. The latter are, in
some directions, abrupt, lofty, and vast, especially on the eastern
side, where the sterile mass of Blackstone Edge shuts out the
view; whilst a wild brotherhood of heathery hills, belonging to
the same range, wind about the scene in a semicircle, which
stretches far away, out of sight, in the north-west. But the
landscape upon the immediate borders of the lake is of a rural
and serene character, though touched here and there with moorland
sterility; and there is hardly a thing in sight to remind a
spectator that he is surrounded by the most populous manufacturing
district in the world. But the distant rumble of train
after train, thundering through the neighbouring valley, and the
railway whistle, rising up clear over the green hill north of
the water, are sufficient to dispel any reverie which the sight
of the lake and its surrounding scenery may lead to. On
holidays, in summer time, the green country around the margin
of this water is animated by companies of visitors from the hill
sides, and the villages and towns of the neighbouring valleys.
A little steamer plies upon it; and boats may be hired at the
Fisherman's Inn, and other places around the banks. The
scattered farm-houses of the vicinity, and the two or three country
inns on the borders of the lake, are merry with pleasure parties.
In winter, the landscape about "Hollingworth" is wild and
lonesome; and the water is sometimes so completely frozen over
that a horse and light vehicle may be driven across it, from bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
to bank, a mile's distance. It is a favourite resort of skaters,
from the surrounding districts; though the ice is often dangerously
uneven in some places, by reason of strong springs,
and other causes. Many accidents have happened through
skating upon insecure parts in the ice of this water. Going
home late one night in the depth of winter, to my residence
by the side of this lake, I found the midnight scene dimly
illumined in the distance by a gleam of lights upon the lake;
and the sound of pick-axes breaking up the ice, fell with a
startling significance upon the ear. Our dog, "Captain," did
not come out to meet me, when I whistled, as usual; and
I hurried, by a short cut over the fields and through the wood,
towards the spot where the lights were visible. There I found
a company of farmers and weavers, standing upon the bank,
with one or two of the wealthy employers from the village of
Littleborough, who had drags in their hands, and were giving
directions to a number of workmen who were breaking a
channel for the passage of a boat to a spot where the ice
had broken in with the weight of three young men belonging
to the neighbourhood. This melancholy midnight gathering
were working by lantern-light, to recover the bodies from
the water. I remained upon the spot until two of the corpses
were brought to the bank, and removed in a cart to the
farm-house where I resided, previous to being conveyed to
their homes in the distant town, later on in the morning, and
while it was yet dark. I shall never forget the appearance of
those fresh-looking youths, as they lay stretched side by side,
in their skating gear, upon a table, in the long passage which
led up to my bed-chamber.</p>

<p>The margin of the lake is adorned with patches of wood
in some places; and the hills stand around the scene in picturesque
disorder. At certain seasons of the year, flocks of
wild fowl may be seen resting upon its waters. There are other
lakes farther up in the hills; but the position and beauty of
Hollingworth make it a favourite with visitors to the district.</p>

<p>the Littleborough inns are throng with sportsmen, equipped for
the grouse shooting; for which sport the moors of the neighbourhood
are famous. Littleborough has a modern look from
the railway station, near to which the new church stands, on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
slight elevation, about the centre of the place, and upon the
site of the old one. Yet, though the village has a modern
appearance, everything known of its history shows that it is a
settlement of considerable antiquity; perhaps, as early as the
time of Agricola, the Roman.</p>

<p>The old chapel at Littleborough, which was a primitive
building in appearance, was licensed for mass, by the Abbot of
Whalley, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1476. It remained in its original architectural
state until it became dangerously ruinous in some parts, and was
taken down about thirty years ago, to make way for the present
church. The <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, for 1844, p. 182, contains
an interesting description of the new church.</p>

<p>In the immediate vicinity of Littleborough, there are several
interesting old houses, now standing upon sites where families
of importance in past times settled very early. Some of these
families have become extinct in the male line; the property of
others has changed hands, like Scholefield Hall, Stubley Hall,
Lightowlers, and Windy Bank. Few of these old families have
held together and flourished, through the mutations of time, like
the family of Newall, of Town House, near Littleborough,
respecting which I find the following passage in the <i>Gentleman's
Magazine</i>, June, 1844, p. 593, which serves to elucidate the
character and position of a large portion of the ancient landlords
of the parish of Rochdale:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The family of Newall is one of those ancient families who have for centuries
resided on their parental estate, but in the retirement of respectable life holding the
rank of yeomanry, which, in former times, and particularly in the age when the
Newalls first settled in Lancashire, formed no unimportant portion of society&mdash;sufficiently
elevated beyond the humbler classes to preserve a tolerable degree of
influence and authority amongst them; while they were sheltered in their retirement
from those political storms which distracted the higher circles of the community,
and which led to the ruin of many of the best families of the kingdom, and to the
confiscation of their estates.</p></blockquote>

<p>Burke's <i>Visitation of Seats and Arms</i> contains a long account of
the Newalls, of Town House, Hare Hill, and Wellington Lodge,
Littleborough, an influential family in this neighbourhood during
several centuries past; and still owners and occupiers of their
old estates, as well as extensive woollen manufacturers.</p>

<p>The following arms, illustrative of the connections of the
Newall family, are placed, with others, in the window of
Littleborough chapel:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Kyrkeshagh</span>, of Town House: Or, on a chief per pale gules and sable three
bezants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Litholres</span>, of Litholres: Vert, a lion rampant, or semé of calthraps sable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Newall</span>, of Town House: Quarterly, first and fourth, Per pale gules and azure,

<p><span class="smcap">Belfield</span>, of Cleggswood: Ermine, on a chief qu. a label of five points ar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ten other shields contain the arms of the ancient families
of the district, as Bamford of Shore, Ingham of Cleggswood,
Halliwell of Pike House, &amp;c., and those used by the bishop of
the diocese, the clergy connected with the parish, and some of
the gentry of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>As we left Littleborough, I began, once more, to speculate
upon the claims set up for it as having been a Roman station;
but my thoughts had no firmer footing than the probabilities put
forth by Dr. Whittaker, and some other writers, who have,
perhaps, followed him. Yet, the fact that the silver arm of a
small Roman statue of Victory, with an inscription thereon, was
dug up in the neighbourhood some time ago, together with the
direction of the Roman road as marked in the late ordnance map,
and the visible remains of a small, triangular-shaped entrenchment,
on each side of the road, on the summit of Blackstone Edge, seem
to support the probabilities which gave rise to the opinion, and
may yet enable the antiquarians of Lancashire to give us something
more certain about the matter than I can pretend to.</p>

<p>Passing under the railway arch near the church, and leaving
the woody glen of Cleggswood on the right hand, we began to
ascend the hills by the winding road which crosses the canal, and
leads through a little hamlet called "Th' Durn," consisting of an
old substantial house or two by the roadside, and a compact body
of plain cottages, with a foundry in the middle. "Th' Durn"
is situated on one of the shelves of land which the high road
crosses in the ascent of Blackstone Edge; and overlooks the vale
in the direction of Todmorden. It is shaded on the south
by a steep hill, clothed with fir, and stunted oaks. Over that
hill-top, on the summit of a wild eminence, above the din and
travel of mankind, stand three remarkable old folds, called
"Th' Whittaker," "Th' Turner," and "Th' Sheep Bonk,"
like eagles' nests, overlooking, on the east, the heathery solitudes
lying between there and Blackstone Edge, the silent
domain of moor fowl and black-faced sheep; seldom trodden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
by human feet, except those of a wandering gamekeeper, or a
few sportsmen, in August. Looking forth from this natural
observatory, about where "Th' Whittaker" stands, the view
to westward takes in an extensive landscape. The vale of
the Roch is under the eye in that direction, with its pretty
sinuosities, its receding dells, and indescribable varieties of
undulation; nearly surrounded by hills, of different height and
aspect. Distance lends some "enchantment to the view," as
the eye wanders over the array of nature spread out below&mdash;green
dells, waving patches of wood, broad, pleasant pastures;
the clear lake of "Hollingworth" rippling below; old farm-houses,
scattered about the knolls and cloughs, by the side
of brooklets that shine silverly in the distance; the blue
smoke curling up distinctly from each little hamlet and village;
mills, collieries, tenter-fields, and manifold evidences of the
native industry and manufacturing vigour of the district. In
these valleys, all nature seems to yield tribute to the energy
of the inhabitants, and rural life and manufacture work into
each other's hands with advantage. Standing on this spot,
with these things spread out before me, I have been struck
with the belief, that this unfavourable region for agriculture
would not have been so well cultivated even as it is now,
but for the manufacturing system. Far west, the eye rests
upon the town of Rochdale, with its clusters of chimneys,
and hovering canopy of smoke; the small square tower of
its old church, and the steeples of St. Stephen's and St. James's,
with the town-clad ridges of Wardleworth and Castleton,
clearly seen, if the day be fine. On a still Sunday afternoon,
in summer time, I have sat upon the hill-top at "Whittaker,"
listening to the distant sound of Rochdale bells, that notable peal
of eight, the music of which I shall never forget; and which I
would back for a trifle against any bells in England for sweetness.
And, at such a time, as evening came on, when "lowing herds
wind slowly o'er the lea," I have almost fancied that I could
hear the Sunday chime of Rochdale Old Church, "My soul,
praise the Lord," come floating up the vale, in the twilight,
with a wonderful charm of peace and solemnity in the sound.
Immediately above "Th' Durn," the high road leading up to
Blackstone Edge rises again as we pass by the old public-house
called "Th' Wet Rake," or "Weet Rake." This house stands
at the foot of a steep path leading to "Windy Bank," an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
stone hall, once inhabited by an ancient family of the neighbourhood.
Windy Bank stands upon the edge of a rocky eminence,
rising almost perpendicularly from the road-side by which we
had to go. There used to be a carter in Rochdale, known by
the name of "Old Woggy," who upset his cart in the craggy
road called "Windy Bonk Steele." He returned to his master
in the town with the tidings. "Woggy" always stammered
in his speech, but in this case he was worse than usual;
and his looks told more than his tongue. His master watched
in vain for "Woggy's" painful delivery, in the usual way;
but tired at last, he said, "Sing it, mon!" when "Wog"
immediately sang out, with a fluent voice,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Aw've wauted wi' th' cart at th' Wyndy Bonk Steele,</span><br />
<span class="i2">An' aw've broken th' tone wheel.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>As we wound round the foot of the rock on the top of which
"Windy Bank" stands, we found the road rutty and uneven,
being covered with the perishable sandstone from the hill, broken
up and ploughed into slushy gutters, by stone-waggons from
the quarries, thereabouts. Pike House, the seat of the old local
family of Halliwell&mdash;one of whom endowed the Free School
at Littleborough&mdash;stands near the north side of the road here;
and, at a short distance behind, there is an interesting house,
formerly of some importance, with a quaint fold attached,
called "Lightowlers." Driving on close by the edge of the deep
clough called "Sladen Hollow," a hundred yards more brought
us to the "Moor Cock Inn," formerly a much more lively place
than now, when this mountain road was the great thoroughfare
between Lancashire and Yorkshire. The "Moor Cock" was the
last house but one on the Lancashire side of Blackstone Edge.
The house has a rude, wholesome look still, but is little frequented.
Few folk go up that road now, except stone-getters, sand-knockers,
shepherds, sportsmen, and a few curious wanderers. We agreed
to leave the drag at the "Moor Cock," and walk up Blackstone
Edge on foot. "Gray Bobby" was pleased with the prospect
of a feed and a rest; for it is tough work upon these hill-sides.
He seemed to look round with a thoughtful eye, and pricked
his ears to the tread of the brisk young mountaineer&mdash;albeit he
had a lame leg and a crutch&mdash;who came forth to lose his traces
and lead him to the stable. As "Bobby" looked at the stable,
I could almost imagine him saying to himself, "There's no place
like home;" it looked so rough. In the house we found a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
hardy-looking men; brown-faced, broad-shouldered moor farmers
or shepherds, apparently, who did a little weaving. Their
sagacious dogs lounged about the floor. Such men, in such
places, generally receive strangers as if they were "fain to
see aught at's wick." They happened to have a liberal
newspaper among them, and free trade was the topic of their
talk; as it was almost everywhere at that time. Their conversation
showed, by its sensible earnestness, that there were
men, even up there, who knew who paid for the great protection
delusion. I have often been amused by the blunt,
shrewd discourse of country people in the manufacturing
districts, respecting the difference in the condition and feelings
of the people in the reigns of "George o' owd George's,"
and his brother, "Bill o' George's," and the condition of
the people now, in the reign of the "little woman at coom
a-seein' us latly." In previous reigns, the tone of their loyalty
might have been summed up in what "Jone o' Greenfelt"
says of his wife, "Margit:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Hoo's naut ogen th' king,</span><br />
<span class="i4">But hoo likes a fair thing,</span><br />
<span class="i0">An' hoo says hoo con tell when hoo's hurt.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>I have heard them talk of kings, and statesmen, "wi' kindling
fury i' their breasts;" and, in their "brews" and clubs, which
meet for the spread of information, they discuss the merits of
political men and measures, and "ferlie at the folk in Lunnon,"
in a shrewd, trenchant style, which would astonish some members
of the collective wisdom of the nation, could they but
conveniently overhear it. The people of Lancashire, generally,
are industrious collectors of political information, from such
sources as they can command. They possess great integrity
of judgment, and independence of character, and cannot be long
blinded to the difference between wise statesmen and political
knaves. They are an honest and a decent people, and would be
governed by such. They evince some sparks of perception of
what is naturally due to themselves, as well as to their masters;
and they only know how to be loyal to others who are loyal
to themselves.</p>

<p>When the lame ostler had attended to his charge, he came
into the house and sat down with the rest. Somehow, the
conversation glided in the direction of Robert Burns, and we
were exchanging quotations from his poems and songs, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
one of us came to a halt in reciting a passage. To our surprise,
the young limper who had rubbed down "Grey Bobby,"
took up the broken thread, and finished the lines correctly,
with good discretion, and evident relish. I fancied that we
were having it all to ourselves; but the kind-hearted poet who
"mourned the daisy's fate," had been at the "Moor Cock"
before us, and touched a respondent chord in the heart of
our ostler. I forget who it is that says, "It is the heart which
makes the life;" but it is true, and it is the heart which sings in
Robert Burns, and the heart will stir to the sound all the world
over. How many political essays, and lectures, and election
struggles, would it take to produce the humanising effect which
the song, "A man's a man for a' that," has awakened? It
would sound well in the British houses of parliament, sung in
chorus, occasionally, between the speeches.</p>

<p>After resting ourselves about three-quarters of an hour in the
Moor Cock, we started up the hill-side, to a point of the road a
little past the toll-bar and the old oil-mill in the hollow, at the
right hand. Here we struck across the moor, now wading
through the heather, now leaping over ruts and holes, where
blocks of stone had been got out; then squashing through a
patch of mossy swamp, and sinking into the wet turf at every
step, till we reached the moss-covered pavement, which the
ordnance surveyors have called a "Roman road." It is entirely
out of any way of travel. A clearly-defined and regular line of
road of about forty feet wide, and which we traced and walked
upon up to the summit of the Edge, and down the Yorkshire
side, a distance of nearly two miles from our starting place upon
the track. We could distinguish it clearly more than a mile
beyond the place we stopped at, to a point where it crossed the
road at Ripponden, and over the moor beyond, in a north-westerly
direction, preserving the same general features as it exhibited in
those parts where it was naked to the eye. Here and there, we
met with a hole in the road, where the stones of the pavement
had been taken out and carried away. While we were resting
on a bank at this old road-side, one of the keepers of the moor
came up with his dogs, and begged that we would be careful not
to use any lights whilst upon the moor, for fear of setting fire to
the heath, which was inflammably-dry. I took occasion to ask
him what was the name of the path we were upon. He said he
did not know, but he had always heard it called "Th' Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
Road." At a commanding point, where this old pavement
reaches the edge of "Blackstone," from the Lancashire side, the
rocky borders of the road rise equally and abruptly, in two slight
elevations, opposite each other, upon which we found certain
weather-worn blocks of stone, half buried in the growth of the
moor. There was a similarity in the general appearance, and a
certain kind of order visible, in the arrangement of these remains,
which looked not unlikely to be the relics of some heavy ancient
masonry, once standing upon these elevations; and at the spot
which is marked, is the line of the "Roman Road," in the
ordnance maps, as an "Entrenchment."</p>

<p>The view along the summits of the vast moors, from any of
the higher parts of this mountain barrier between the two counties
of Lancaster and York, looks primevally-wild and grand, towards
the north and south; where dark masses of solitude stretch away
as far as the eye can see. In every other direction, the landscape
takes in some cultivated land upon the hill-sides, and the bustle
and beauty of many a green vale, lying low down among these
sombre mountains; with many a picturesque and cultivated
dingle, and green ravine, higher up in the hills, in spots where
farm-houses have stood for centuries; sometimes with quaint
groups of cottages gathered round them, and clumps of trees
spreading about, shading the currents of moorland rivulets, as
they leap down from the hills. In the valleys, the river
winding through green meadows; mansions and mills, villages
and churches, and scattered cottages, whose little windows wink
cheerfully through their screen of leaves&mdash;</p>

down upon the changeful life of man in the valleys at their feet,
with such an air of strength and serenity, whilst the toiling
swarms of Lancashire and Yorkshire are scattered over the
landscape beyond, in populous hives&mdash;the contrast is peculiarly
strong; and I have wondered whether these old hills, which
have seen the painted Celt tracking his prey through the woods
and marshes below, and worshipping "in the eye of light,"
among wild fanes of rock, upon these mountain wildernesses&mdash;which
have heard the tread of the legions of old Rome; and
have watched the brave Saxon, swinging his axe among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
forest trees, and, with patient labour, slowly making these valleys
into green and homely pasturages; and which still behold
the iron horses of modern days, rushing along the valley
every hour, snorting fire and steam: I have wondered whether
the hills, at whose feet so many generations of brave men have
come and gone, like swathes of grass, might not yet again
see these native valleys of mine as desolate and stirless as
themselves. These moorland hills, the bleak companions of
mist, and cloud, and tempest, rise up one after another upon
the scene, till they grow dim on the distant edge of the sky.
Lying upon my back, among the heather, I looked along the
surface of the moors; and I shall long remember the peculiar
loneliness of the landscape seen in that way. Nothing was in
sight but a wild infinity of moors and mountain tops, succeeding
each other, like heaving waves, of varied form. Not
a sign of life was visible over all the scene, except immediately
around us, where, now and then, a black-faced sheep
lifted its head above the heather, and stared, with a mingled
expression of wonder and fear, at the new intruders upon
its solitary pasturage. Occasionally, a predatory bird might
be seen upon these hills, flitting across the lone expanse&mdash;an
highwayman of the skies; and, here and there, the moorfowl
sprang up from the cover, in whirring flight, and with
that wild clucking cry, which, in the stillness of the scene,
came upon the ears with a clearness that made the solitude
more evident to the senses. A rude shepherd's hut, too,
could be seen sheltering near a cluster of crags upon the
hill-side, and hardly distinguishable from the heathery mounds,
which lay scattered over the surface of the moor. But, in
the distance, all seemed one wilderness of untrodden sterility&mdash;as
silent as death. The sky was cloudless whilst we wandered
upon those barren heights: and the blue dome looked down,
grandly-calm, upon the landscape, which was covered with
a glorious sunshine.</p>

<p>Heaven and earth were two magnificent stillnesses, which
appeared to gaze serenely and steadily at each other, with
the calm dignity and perfect understanding of ancient friends,
whose affinities can never be unsettled, except by the fiat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
of Him who first established them. Looking horizontally
along the moors, in this manner, nothing was visible of those
picturesque creases, which lie deep between these mountain
ridges, and teem with the industrious multitudes of Lancashire
and Yorkshire.</p>

<p>These hills form part of a continuous range, running across
the island, in different elevations, and familiarly known as the
"Backbone of England." Looking southward and south-east, in
the direction of the rocky waste called "Stanedge,"&mdash;which is
crossed by the high road from Manchester to Huddersfield&mdash;and
"Buckstones," which, according to local tradition, was
formerly an highwayman's haunt,&mdash;the whole country is one
moorland wild; and the romantic hills of Saddleworth, with
the dim summits of the Derbyshire mountains, bound the
view. Northward, the landscape has the same general appearance.
In this direction, Studley Pike lately occupied the
summit of a lofty moorland, overlooking the valley between
Hebden Bridge and the town of Todmorden; which is part
of a district famous for its comely breed of people, and
for the charms of its scenery. Studley Pike was a tall
stone tower, erected to commemorate the restoration of peace,
at the end of our wars with Napoleon. Singularly, it came
thundering to the ground on the day of the declaration of war
against Russia.</p>

<p>On the west, the valley of the Roch, with its towns and
villages, stretches away out from this group of hills. Littleborough
nestles immediately at the foot of the mountain; and the
eye wanders along the vale, from hamlet to hamlet, till it reaches
the towns of Rochdale, Bury, Heywood, Middleton, and the
smoky canopy of Manchester in the distance. On a favourable
day, many other large and more distant Lancashire towns may
be seen. On the east, or Yorkshire side, looking towards Halifax,
the hills appear to be endless. The valleys are smaller and more
numerous, often lying in narrow gorges and woody ravines
between the hills, hardly discernable from the distance. The
mountain sides have a more cultivated look, and hovering halos
of smoke, rising up from the mountain hollows, with, sometimes,
the tops of factory chimneys peering out from the vales, show
where villages like Ripponden and Sowerby are situated. On
the distant edge of the horizon, a grey cloud hanging steadily
beyond the green hill, called "King Cross" marks the locality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
of the town of Halifax. Green plots of cultivated land are
creeping up the steep moors; and comfortable farm-houses, with
folds of cottages, built of the stone of the district, are strewn
about the lesser hills, giving life and beauty to the scene.</p>

<p>For native men, the moors of this neighbourhood, as well
as the country seen from them, contain many objects of
interest. The hills standing irregularly around; the rivers and
streams; the lakes and pools below, and in the fissures of the
mountains&mdash;we knew their names. The lakes, or reservoirs,
about Blackstone Edge, form remarkable features in its scenery.
One of these, "Blackstone Edge Reservoir," takes its name from
the mountain upon whose summit it fills an extensive hollow.
This lake is upwards of two miles, close by the water's edge.
The scenery around it is a table-land, covered with heather,
and rocks, and turfy swamps. The other two, "White Lees"
and "Hollingworth," lie lower, about half way down the
moors: "White Lees" in a retired little glen, about a mile
north-west of the "White House," on the top of Blackstone
Edge; and "Hollingworth," the largest and most picturesque
of the three, is situated about two miles south-west of the same
spot. Close by the side of the high road from Lancashire, over
these hills into Yorkshire, this old hostelry, known as "Th'
White House," is situated near the top of Blackstone Edge, looking
towards Lancashire. The division-stone of the two counties
stands by the road-side, and about half a mile eastward of this
public-house. The northern bank of the road, upon which
the division-stone stands, shuts out from view the lake called
"Blackstone Edge Reservoir"&mdash;a scene which "skylark never
warbles o'er." A solitary cart-road leads off the road, at the
corner of the reservoir, and, crossing the moor in a north-easterly
direction, goes down into a picturesque spot, called
"Crag Valley," or "The Vale of Turvin," for it is known by
both names. This valley winds through the heart of the moors,
nearly four miles, emptying itself at Mytholmroyd, in the
vale of Todmorden. Fifty years ago, "Crag Valley" was
an unfrequented region, little known, and much feared. Now
there are thriving clusters of population in it; and pretty homesteads,
in isolated situations, about the sides of the clough.
Manufacture has crept up the stream. "Turvin" is becoming
a resort of ramblers from the border towns and villages of
the two counties, on account of the picturesque wildness of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
scenery. In some places the stream dashes through deep gorges
of rock, overhung with wood; peeping through which, one might
be startled by sight of a precipitous steep, shrouded with trees,
and the foaming water rushing wildly below over its fantastic
channel. There are several mills in the length of the valley now;
and, in level holms, down in the hollow, the land is beautifully
green. The vale is prettily wooded in many parts; but the
barren hills overlook the whole length of Turvin. In former
times, the clough was notable among the people of the surrounding
districts, as a rendezvous of coiners and robbers; and the
phrase "a Turvin shilling," grew out of the dexterity of these
outlaws, who are said to have lurked a long time in the
seclusion of this moorland glen.</p>

<p>Approaching Turvin by the rough road across the moor, from
the top of Blackstone Edge, it leads into a deep corner of the
valley, in which stands the church of "St. John's in the Wilderness,"
built a few years ago, for the behoof of the inhabitants of
the neighbouring moors, and for a little community of factory
people in this remote nook of the earth.</p>

<p>Upon the summit of one of the neighbouring mountains, there
is a great platform of desolation, distinguished, even among this
stony waste, as "The Wilderness;" and I think that whoever
has visited the spot will be inclined to say that the roughest
prophet that ever brooded over his visions in solitary places of
the earth, could not well wish for a wilder Patmos than this
moor-top. On the right hand of the public-house, near St.
John's Church, several rough roads lead in different directions.
The centre one goes up through a thick wood which clothes the
mountain side, and on by winding routes to this "cloud-capped"
wilderness. On a distant part of this bleak tract stand two remarkable
Druidical remains, called "Th' Alder Stones," or the
"Altar Stones,"&mdash;sombre masses of rock, upon which the Druid
priests of our island performed their sacrificial rites, before the
wild Celts of the district. The position and formation of these
stones, which have each a sloping top, with a hollow in the
middle, and a channel thence downward, seem to confirm the
character attributed to them.</p>

<p>Returning from "St. John's in the Wilderness," towards Blackstone
Edge, a quaint stone building, called "Crag Hall," occupies
a shady situation upon the hill-side, at the right hand of the vale,
and at the edge of the wild tract called "Erringdale Moor."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
This ancient hall contains many specimens of carved oak furniture,
which have been preserved with the building, from the time
of its old owners. A few years ago, the keeper of Erringdale
moor dwelt in it, and kept the place in trim as a lodge, for the
entertainment of the owners of the moor, and their sporting
friends, in the grouse season.</p>

<p>Between the moor-side on which "Crag Hall" is situated, and
the road up to the top of Blackstone Edge, a moorland stream
runs along its rocky channel, in the deep gut of the hills.
I remember that many years ago I wandered for hours, one
summer day, up this lonely water, in company with a young
friend of mine. In the course of our ramble upon the banks of
the stream, little dreaming of any vestiges of human creation
in that region, we came almost upon the roof of a cottage,
rudely, but firmly built of stone. We descended the bank by a
sloping path, leading to the door. There was no smoke, no
stir nor sound, either inside or out; but, through the clean
windows, we saw a pair of hand-looms, with an unfinished piece
upon them. We knocked repeatedly, hoping to obtain some
refreshment after our stroll; but there was no answer; and
just as we were about to leave the lonely tenement, and take
our way homewards&mdash;for the twilight was coming on, and we
had nearly ten miles to go&mdash;we heard the sound of a pair of clogs
in the inside of the cottage; and the door was opened by a tall,
strong man, apparently about thirty-five years of age. His
clear-complexioned face was full of frankness and simplicity.
His head was large and well-formed, and covered with bristling
brown hair, cut short. Yawning, and stretching his arms out,
he accosted us at once&mdash;as if we were old friends, for whom
he had been looking some time&mdash;with, "Well, heaw are yo,
to-day?" We asked him for a drink of water. He invited
us in, and set two chairs for us in a little kitchen, where
the furniture was rudely-simple and sound, and everything in
good order, and cleaned to its height. He brought forth
pitchers full of buttermilk, plenty of thick oat-cakes, and the
sweet butter for which these hills are famous; and we feasted.
The cool of the evening was coming on, and there was no fire
in his grate; so he fetched a great armful of dry heather from
an inner room, and, cramming it into the fire-place, put a light
to it. Up blazed the inflammable eilding, with a crackling sound,
making the room look cheerful as himself. A few books lay upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
the window-sill, which we asked leave to look at. He handed
them to us, commenting on them, in a shrewd and simple way,
as he did so. They were chiefly books on mathematics, a science
which he began to discourse upon with considerable enthusiasm.
Now, my young companion happened to have a passion for
that science; and he no sooner discovered this affinity between
himself and our host, than to it they went pell-mell, with books
and chalk, upon the clean flags; and I was bowled out of the
conversation at once. Leaving them to their problems, and
circles, and triangles, I walked out upon the moor; and sitting
upon a knoll above the house, wrote a little rhyme in my note-book,
which some years after appeared in the corner of a Manchester
newspaper. When I returned they were still at it, ding-dong,
about something or another in differential calculus; and I
had great difficulty in impressing upon the mind of my companion
the important area lying between us and our homes.
This lonely mathematician, it seemed, was a bachelor, and he
got his living partly by weaving, and partly by watching the
moor, for the owners; and as I looked upon him I almost envied
the man his strong frame, his sound judgment, his happy unsophisticated
mind, and his serene and simple way of life. He
walked over the moor with us nearly two miles, without hat,
conversing about his books, and the lonely manner of his life, with
which he appeared to be perfectly contented. At our parting,
he pressed us to come over the moors again the first opportunity,
and spend a day with him at his cottage. I have hardly ever
met with another man who seemed so strong and sound in
body; and so frank, and sensible, and simple-hearted, as this
mathematical eremite of the mountains. That enthusiastic attachment
to science, which so strongly distinguishes him in my
remembrance, is a common characteristic of the native working-people
of Lancashire, among whom, in proportion to the population,
there is an extraordinary number of well-read and practised
mechanics, botanists, musicians, and mathematicians; and the
booksellers in the towns of the county, know that any standard
works upon these subjects, and some upon divinity, are sure to
find a large and ready sale among the operative classes.</p>

<p>We wore the afternoon far away in rambling about the high
and open part of Blackstone Edge, between the group of rocks
called "Robin Hood's Bed," and the solitary inn called the
"White House," upon the Yorkshire road. Wading through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
fern and heather, and turfy swamps; climbing rocks, and
jumping over deep gutters and lodgments of peaty water,
had made us so hungry and weary, that we made the best
of our way to this inn, while the sun was yet up above
the hills. Here, the appetite we had awakened was amply
satisfied; and we refreshed, and rested ourselves a while,
conversing about the country around us, and exchanging anecdotes
of its remarkable local characters, and reminiscences of
our past adventures in the neighbourhood. Many of these
related to "Old Joe," the quaint gamekeeper, at Hollingworth,
a kind of local "Leather Stocking," who has many a time rowed
us about the lake in his fishing-boat.</p>

<p>When we came out of the inn, the sun had gone down upon
the opposite side of the scene. Night's shadows were climbing
the broad steeps; but the summit-lines of the hills still showed
in clear relief, against the western sky, where the sunset's glory
lingered. In every other direction, the skirts of the landscape
were fading from view. Rochdale town, with its church tower
and stacks of tall chimneys, had disappeared in the distance.
The mountainous wastes stretching away on the north, south,
and east, were melting into indistinct masses; and, below the
hills, quiet evening's dreamy shades were falling softly down,
and folding away for the night the hamleted valleys between
Blackstone Edge and the boundary of the scene. Day's curtains
were closing to; the watchers of night were beginning their
golden vigil; and all the air seemed thick with dreams. We
descended from the moor-top by a steep path, which diverges,
on the right-hand side of the highway, a little below the
"White House," and cuts off a mile of the distance between that
point and the "Moor Cock," where we had left "Grey Bobby"
and the "Whitechapel." Far down, from scattered cots and
folds, little lights were beginning to glimmer. That frontlet
jewel of mild evening's forehead&mdash;"the star that bids the shepherd
fold"&mdash;was glowing above us, and, here and there, twinklings
of golden fire were stealing out from the blue expanse. As we
picked our way down the moor, the stillness of the tract around
us seemed to deepen as the light declined; and there was no distinguishable
sound in the neighbourhood of our path, except the
silvery tricklings of indiscernable rills. From the farms below,
the far-off bark of dogs and lowing of cattle came floating up,
mingled with the subdued rush and rattle of railway trains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
rushing along the valley. Half an hour's walk down the hill
brought us back to the "Moor Cock." Limper, the ostler,
got "Grey Bobby" from the stable, and put him into the
harness. Out came the folk of the house, to see us off. Our
frisky tit treated us to another romp; after which we drove
down the road, in the gloaming, and on through Littleborough
and Smallbridge, to Rochdale, by the light of the stars.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi1"><span class="smcap">One</span> Saturday afternoon, about midsummer, I was invited
by a friend to spend a day at his house, in the green
outskirts of Heywood. The town has a monotonous,
cotton-spinning look; yet, it is surrounded by a pleasant
country, and has some scenery of a picturesque description in
its immediate neighbourhood. Several weeks previous to this
invitation had been spent by me wholly amongst the bustle of
our "cotton metropolis," and, during that time, I had often
thought how sweetly summer was murmuring with its "leafy
lips" beyond the town, almost unseen by me except when I
took a ride to a certain suburb, and wandered an hour or
two in a scene upon which the season seemed to smile almost
in vain, and where the unsatisfactory verdure was broken up
by daub-holes and rows of half-built cottages, and the air mixed
with the aroma of brick-kilns and melting lime. Sometimes, too,
I stole down into the market-place, on a Saturday morning,
to smell at the flowers and buy a "posy" for my button-hole.
It reminded me of the time when I used to forage about
my native hedges, for bunches of the wild rose and branches of
white-blossomed thorn. But now, as the rosy time of the year
grew towards its height, I began to hanker after those moors
and noiseless glens of Lancashire, where, even yet, nature seems
to have it all her own way. I longed for the quiet valleys and
their murmuring waters; the rustling trees; and the cloudless
summer sky seen through fringed openings in the wildwood's
leafy screen. Somebody says, that "we always find better men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
in action than in repose;" and though there are contemplative
spirits who instinctively shun the din of towns, and, turning to
the tranquil seclusions of nature, read a lofty significance in
its infinite forms and moods of beauty, yet, the grand battle
of life lies where men are clustered. Great men can live
greatly anywhere; but ordinary people must be content to
snatch at any means likely to improve or relieve their lot;
and it will do any care-worn citizen good to "consider the
lilies of the field" a little, now and then. Country folk come
to town to relieve the monotony of their lives; and town's folk
go to the country for refreshment and repose. To each the
change may be beneficial&mdash;at least I thought so; and, as light as
leaf upon tree, I hailed my journey; for none of Robin Hood's
men ever went to the greenwood with more pleasure than I.</p>

<p>It was nearly three when we passed the Old Church, on
our way to the station. The college lads, in their quaint blue
suits, and flat woollen caps, were frolicking about the quadrangle
of that ancient edifice which helps to keep alive the name
of Humphrey Chetham. The omnibuses were rushing by,
with full loads. I said "full loads;" but there are omnibuses
running out of Manchester, which I never knew to be so full
that they would not "just hold another." But on we went,
talking about anything which was uppermost; and in a few
minutes we were seated in the train, and darting over the
tops of that miserable jungle known by the name of "Angel
Meadow." The railway runs close by a little hopeful oasis in
this moral desert&mdash;the "Ragged School," at the end of Ashley
Lane; and, from the carriage window, we could see "Charter-street"&mdash;that
notable den of Manchester outcasts. These two
significant neighbours&mdash;"Charter-street" and the "Ragged
School"&mdash;comment eloquently upon one another. Here, all is
mental and moral malaria, and the revelry of the place sounds
like a forlorn cry for help. There the same human elements are
trained, by a little timely culture, towards honour and usefulness.
Any man, with an unsophisticated mind, looking upon the
two, might be allowed to say, "Why not do enough of <i>this</i> to
cure <i>that</i>?" On the brow of Red Bank, the tower and gables
of St. Chad's Church overlook the swarming hive which fills the
valley of the Irk; and which presents a fine field for those who
desire to spread the gospel among the heathen, and enfranchise
the slave. And if it be true that the poor are "the riches of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
church of Christ," there is an inheritance there worth looking
after by any church which claims the title. Up rose a grove
of tall chimneys from the streets lining the banks of the little
slutchy stream, that creeps through the hollow, slow and slab,
towards its confluence with the Irwell; where it washes the
base of the rocks upon which, five hundred years ago, stood
the "Baron's Hall," or manor house of the old lords of Manchester.
On the same spot, soon after the erection of the
Collegiate Church, that quaint quadrangular edifice was built as
a residence for the warden and fellows, which afterwards became,
in the turns of fortune, a mansion of the Earls of Derby, a garrison,
a prison, an hospital, and a college. By the time we had
taken a few reluctant sniffs of the curiously-compounded air of
that melancholy waste, we began to ascend the incline, and lost
sight of the Irk, with its factories, dyehouses, brick-fields, tan-pits,
and gas-works; and the unhappy mixture of stench,
squalor, smoke, hard work, ignorance, and sin, on its borders;
and, after a short stoppage at Miles Platting, our eyes were
wandering over the summer fields. Nature was drest in her
richest robes; and every green thing looked lush with beauty.
As we looked abroad on this wide array, it was delightful
to see the sprouting honeysuckle, and the peace-breathing palm;
and there, too, creeping about the hedges, was that old acquaintance
of life's morning, the bramble, which will be putting
forth "its small white rose" about the time that country folk
begin to house their hay; and when village lads in Lancashire
are gathering gear to decorate their rush-hearts with. Clustering
primroses were there; and the celandine, with burnished leaves
of gold; and wild violets, prancked with gay colours; with
troops of other wild flowers, some full in view, others dimly
seen as we swept on;&mdash;a world of floral beauty thickly embroidering
the green mantle of the landscape, though beyond
the range of discriminating vision; but clear to the eye of
imagination, which assured us that these stars of the earth
were making their old haunts beautiful again. The buttercup
was in the fields, holding its pale gold chalice up to catch the
evening dews. Here and there grew a tuft of slender-stemmed
lilies, graceful and chaste; and then a sweep of blue-bells, tinging
the hedge-sides and the moist slopes under the trees with their
azure hue&mdash;as blue as a patch of sky&mdash;and swinging the incense
from their pendent petals into the sauntering summer wind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Then came the tall foxglove, and bushes of the golden-blossomed
furze, covered with gleaming spears, upon the banks of the
line. Oh, refulgent summer! Time of blossoms and honeydews;
and flowers of every colour! Thy lush fields are rich
with clover and herb-grass! Thy daylights glow with glory;
thy twilights are full of dreamy sights and sounds; and the
sweetest odours of the year perfume the air, when</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The butterfly flits from the flowering tree;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the cowslip and blue-bell are bent by the bee!</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>The throstle sang loud and clear in the trees and dells near the
line, as we rolled along; and the blithe "layrock" made the
air tremble, between heaven and the green meadows, with his
thrilling lyric. That tall, white flower, which country folk
call "posset," spread out its curdy top among the elegant
summer grasses, quietly swaying to and fro with the wind.
And then the daisy was there! There is no flower so well
becomes the hand of a child as the daisy does! That little
"crimson-tippet" companion of the lark, immortalised in the
poet's loving wail! Tiny jewel of the fields of England;
favourite of the child and of the bard! Daisies lay like snow
upon the green landscape; and the hedges were white with the
scented blossom of the thorn. To eyes a little tired of the
city's hives of brick&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Where stoop the sons of care,</span><br />
<span class="i0">O'er plains of mischief, till their souls turn grey&mdash;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>it was refreshing to peer about over the beautiful summer expanse,
towards the blue hills rising on the edge of the horizon,
solemn and serene.</p>

<p>My own impression of the natural charms of this part of
Lancashire is, perhaps, a little warmer and more accepting than
that of an unbiassed stranger would be; for the wheels are beautiful
which roll me towards the country where I first pulled the
wild flowers and listened to the lark. In this district, there are
none of those rich depths of soil which, with little labour and
tilth, burst forth in full crops of grain. But the land is
mostly clothed with pastoral verdure; and the farming is almost
entirely of the dairy kind. It is a country of green hills and
vales, and clusters of dusky mills, surrounded by industrial life;
and, except on the high moorlands, there is very little land now,
even of the old mosses and morasses, which is not inclosed, and
in progress of cultivation. The scenery has features of beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
peculiar to itself. It consists of a succession of ever-varying
undulations, full of sequestered cloughs, and dingles, and shady
corners; threaded by many a little meandering stream, which
looks up at the skies from its green hollow; and which</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">Changes oft its varied lapse,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And ever as it winds, enchantment follows,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And new beauties rise.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>Travellers from the midland and southern counties of England
often notice the scarcity of trees in this quarter. The native
woods were chiefly oak, ash, birch, beech, and yew&mdash;very useful
timbers. But when the time came that Lancashire had to strip
some of its old customs and ornaments, for the fulfilment of its
manufacturing destiny, every useful thing upon the soil was
seized, and applied to the purposes of the new time. The land
itself began to be wanted for other ends than to grow trees upon.
And then, when old landlords happened to be pressed for money,
the timber of their estates&mdash;daily becoming more valuable for
manufacturing necessities&mdash;sometimes presented the readiest way
of raising it. Their lands often followed in the same track.
And now, the landscape looks bald. Trees are scanty and small,
except at a few such places as Hopwood Hall, and Chadderton
Hall; and a few isolated clumps, like that which crests the
top of "Tandle Hills." In that part of this district which lies
between "Boggart Ho' Clough," near the village of Blackley,
on the west, the town of Middleton, on the east, and the Manchester
and Leeds railway line, on the south, there is a wide
platform of level land, called "Th' White Moss." It stands
above the surrounding country; and is quite removed from any
of the great highways of the neighbourhood, which, nevertheless,
wind near to the borders of this secluded moss, with
their restless streams of business. In former days, this tract
has been a densely-wooded wild; and, even within these twenty
years last past, it was one great marsh, in whose peaty swamps
the relics of ancient woods lay buried. Since that time,
nearly two hundred acres of the moss have been brought
into cultivation; and it is said that this part of it now produces
as fine crops as any land in the neighbourhood. In turning
up the bog, enormous roots and branches of trees, principally
oaks, are often met with. Very fine oaks, beeches, firs, and
sometimes yew trees, of a size very seldom met with in this
part of Lancashire in these days, have frequently been found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
embedded in this morass, at a depth of five or six feet. Samuel
Bamford, in his description of the "White Moss," says: "The
stems and huge branches of trees were often laid bare by the
diggers, in cultivating it. Nearly all the trees have been found
lying from west to east, or from west to south. They consist of
oaks, beeches, alders, and one or two fine yews. The roots of
many of them are matted and gnarled, presenting interesting
subjects for reflection on the state of this region in unrecorded
ages. Some of these trees are in part charred when found.
One large oak, lying on the north-west side of the moss, has
been traced to fifteen yards in length, and is twelve feet round."
This moss was one of those lonely places to which the people
of these districts found it necessary to retreat, in order to hold
their political meetings in safety, during that eventful period
of Lancashire history which fell between the years 1815 and
1821. It was a time of great suffering and danger in these parts.
The working people were often driven into riot and disorder by
the desperation of extreme distress; which disorder was often
increased by the discreditable espionage and ruthless severities
employed to crush political discussion among the populace.
Of the gallant band of reformers which led the van of the
popular struggle, many a humble and previously-unnoted pioneer
of liberty has left an heroic mark upon the history of that time.
Some of these are still living; others have been many a year laid
in their graves; but their memories will long be cherished among
a people who know how to esteem men who sincerely love
freedom, and are able to do and to suffer for it, in a brave spirit.</p>

<p>In this active arena of industrialism, there are many places
of interest: old halls and churches; quaint relics of ancient
hamlets, hidden by the overgrowth of modern factory villages;
immense mills, and costly mansions, often belonging to men
who were poor lads a few years ago, wearing wooden clogs,
and carrying woollen pieces home from the loom, upon their
shoulders. As we cross the valley beyond the station, the little
old parish church of Middleton stands in sight, on the top of
a green eminence, about a mile north from the line. In the
interior of this old fane still hang, against the southern wall, the
standard and armour of Sir Richard Assheton, which he dedicated
to St. Leonard of Middleton, on returning from Flodden Field,
where he greatly distinguished himself; taking prisoner Sir John
Foreman, serjeant-porter to James the Sixth of Scotland, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Alexander Barrett, high sheriff of Aberdeen; and capturing the
sword of the standard-bearer of the Scottish king. He led to
the battle a brave array of Lancashire archers, the flower of his
tenantry. At the western base of the hill upon which the church
of St. Leonard is situated, two large cotton factories now stand,
close to the spot which, even so late as the year 1845, was
occupied by the picturesque old hall of the Asshetons, lords of
Middleton. The new gas-works of the town fills part of the
space once covered with its gardens. Middleton lies principally
in the heart of a pleasant vale, with some relics of its ancient
quaintness remaining, such as the antique wood-and-plaster inn,
called the "Boar's Head," in the hollow, in front of the parish
church. The manor of Middleton anciently belonged to the
honour of Clithero, and was held by the Lacies, Earls of Lincoln.
In the reign of Henry III., the heir of Robert de Middleton held a
knight's fee in Middleton, of the fee of Edmund or Edward, Earl
of Lincoln, who held it of the Earls of Ferrars, the king's tenant in
capite. And Baines, in his history of Lancashire, further says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In 3 Edward II., the manor of Middleton is found in the inquisition post-mortem
of Henry de Lacy, amongst the fees belonging to the manor of Tottington, held by
service of Thomas, Earl of Lancaster. With Henry, Earl of Lincoln, this branch of
the Lacys passed away; and their possessions in this country, with his daughter and
heiress, devolved upon Thomas Plantagenet, Earl of Lancaster. The heirs of Robti
(Robert) de Middleton possessed lands in <i>Midelton</i>, by military service, in the reign
of Henry the Third, 1216-1272. At a later period, the manor was possessed by
Richard Barton, Esq.; the first of this family who is recorded in connection with
Middleton was living in the reign of Henry the Fourth, 1410. He died without
surviving issue, and the manor passed to the heirs of his brother, John Barton, Esq.,
whose daughter Margaret having married Ralph Assheton, Esq., a son of Sir John
Assheton, Knt., of Ashton-under-Lyne, he became Lord of Middleton in her right,
in the seventeenth of Henry the Sixth, 1438, and was the same year appointed a
page of honour to that king. He was knight-marshal of England, lieutenant of the
Tower of London, and sheriff of Yorkshire, 1473-1474. He attended the Duke of
Gloucester at the battle of Haldon, or Hutton Field, Scotland, in order to recover
Berwick, and was created a knight <i>banneret</i> on the field for his gallant services,
1483. On the succession of Richard the Third to the crown, he created Sir Ralph
vice-constable of England, by letters patent, 1483.</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus began the first connection of the town of Middleton
with that powerful Lancashire family, the Asshetons, of Ashton-under-Lyne,
in the person of the famous "Black Lad," respecting
whom Dr. Hibbert says, in his historical work upon Ashton-under-Lyne,
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It appears that Ralph Assheton became, by his alliance with a rich heiress, the
lord of a neighbouring manor, named Middleton, and soon afterwards received the
honour of knighthood, being at the same time entrusted with the office of vice-chancellor,
and, it is added, of lieutenant of the Tower. Invested with such authority,
he committed violent excesses in this part of the kingdom. In retaining also
for life the privilege of <i>guld riding</i>, he, on a certain day in the spring, made his appearance
in this manner, clad in black armour (whence his name of the <i>Black Lad</i>),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
mounted on a charger, and attended by a numerous train of his followers, in order
to levy the penalty arising from neglect of clearing the land from <i>carr gulds</i>. The
interference of so powerful a knight, belonging to another lordship, could not but be
regarded by the tenants of Assheton as a tyrannical intrusion of a stranger, and the
name of the <i>Black Lad</i> is at present regarded with no other sentiment than that
of horror. Tradition has, indeed, still perpetuated the prayer that was fervently
ejaculated for a deliverance from his tyranny:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sweet Jesu, for thy mercy's sake,</span><br />
<span class="i2">And for thy bitter passion,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Save us from the axe of the Tower,</span><br />
<span class="i2">And from Sir Ralph of Assheton.</span><br />
</div></div>
</blockquote>

<p>Happily, with the death of this terrible guld-rider of Assheton,
the custom was abolished, but the sum of five shillings is still
reserved from the estate, for the purpose of commemorating it
by an annual ceremony. Ralph Assheton, of Middleton, was an
energetic adherent to the parliamentary cause during the civil
wars. On the 24th September, 1642, about one hundred and
fifty of his tenants, in complete arms, joined the forces of Manchester,
in opposition to the royalists. He commanded the parliamentary
troops at the siege of Warrington. He was engaged
at the siege of Lathom House, and led the Middleton Clubmen
at the siege of Bolton-le-Moors. In 1648 he was a major-general,
and commanded the Lancashire soldiery of the commonwealth,
on the marshalling of the parliamentary forces to oppose the
Duke of Hamilton. In the same year, he took Appleby from
the royalists. His eldest son, Richard, who died an infant,
March 25th, 1631, was supposed to have been bewitched to
death by one Utley, "who, for the crime, was tried at the assizes
at Lancaster, and executed there." His son Ralph espoused the
cause of Charles the Second, and was created a baronet in 1663.</p>

<p>As we glide out of sight of Middleton, a prominent feature
of the landscape, on the opposite side of the railway, is the
wood-crowned summit of "Tandle Hills." These hills overlook
the sequestered dairy farms, and shady dingles of an extensive
district called "Thornham;" which, though surrounded at short
distances by busy manufacturing villages and towns, is a tract
full of quaint farm-folds, grassy uplands and dells, interlaced with
green old English lanes and hedge-rows. Before the train
reaches "Blue Pits," it passes through the estates of the Hopwoods,
of Hopwood; and, at some points, the chimneys and
gables of Hopwood Hall peep through surrounding woods, in a
retired valley, north of the line. As the train begins to slacken
on its approach to the station, the old road-side village of Trub
Smithy, the scene of many a humorous story, lies nestling beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
two or three fields to the south, at the foot of a slope, on
the high road from Manchester to Rochdale. At "Blue
Pits" station, we obeyed the noisy summons to "Change for
Heywood," and were put upon the branch line which leads
thitherward. The railway hence to Heywood winds through
green fields all the way, and is divided from the woods of
Hopwood by a long stripe of canal. As we rolled on, the
moorland heights of Ashworth, Knowl, Rooley, and Lobden,
rose in the back ground before us, seemingly at a short distance,
and before any glimpse was seen of the town of Heywood, lying
low between us and the hills. But, as we drew near, a canopy
of smoky cloud hung over the valley in front; and "we knew
by the smoke"&mdash;as the song says&mdash;that Heywood was near;
even if we had never known it before. Heywood is one of the
last places in the world where a man who judges of the surrounding
country by the town itself, would think of going to
ruralize. But, even in this smoky manufacturing town, which
is so meagre in historic interest, there are some peculiarities connected
with its rise and progress, and the aspects of its present
life; and some interesting traits in the characteristics of its inhabitants.
And, in its surrounding landscape, there are many
picturesque scenes; especially towards the hills, where the rising
grounds are cleft, here and there, by romantic glens, long,
lonesome, and woody, and wandering far up into the moors, like
"Simpson Clough;" and sometimes vales, green and pleasant, by
the quiet water-side, like "Tyrone's Bed," and "Hooley Clough."</p>

<p>As the train drew up to that little station, which always looks
busy when there are a dozen people in the office, the straggling
ends of Heywood streets began to dawn upon us, with the
peeking chimney tops of the cotton mills, which lay yet too low
down to be wholly seen. Some costly mansions were visible
also, belonging to wealthy men of the neighbourhood&mdash;mostly
rich cotton-spinners&mdash;perched on "coignes of vantage," about
the green uplands and hollows in the valley, and generally at a
respectful distance from the town. Many of the cotton mills
began to show themselves entirely&mdash;here and there in clusters&mdash;the
older ones looking dreary, and uninviting to the eye; the new
ones as smart as new bricks and long lines of glittering windows
could make their dull, square forms appear. A number of brick-built
cottages bristled about the summit of a slope which rose in
front of us from the station, and closed from view the bulk of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
the town, in the valley beyond. We went up the slope, and
took a quiet bye-path which leads through the fields, along the
southern edge of Heywood, entering the town near the market-place.
And now, let us take a glance at the history, and some
of the present features of this place.</p>

<p>So far as the history of Heywood is known, it has not been
the arena of any of those great historical transactions of England's
past, which have so shaken and changed the less remote parts of
the country. The present appearance of Heywood would not,
perhaps, be any way delightful to the eye of anybody who had
no local interest in it. Yet, a brief review of the history, and the
quick growth of the place, may not be uninteresting. Heywood
is the capital of the township of Heap, and stands principally
upon a gentle elevation, in a wide valley, about three miles from
each of the towns of Rochdale, Bury, and Middleton. The
township of Heap is in the parish and manor of Bury, of which
manor the Earl of Derby is lord. This manor has been the
property of the Derby family ever since the accession of Henry
VII., after the battle of Bosworth Field, when it was granted
by the king to his father-in-law, Thomas Stanley, first Earl of
Derby, who figures in Shakspere's tragedy of "Richard the Third."
The previous possessors were the Pilkingtons, of Pilkington. Sir
Thomas Pilkington was an active adherent of the York faction,
in the wars of the Roses; and, in a manuscript of Stowe's, his
name appears, with a large number of other friends of Richard,
who "sware Kynge Richard shuld were ye crowne." There is
a secluded hamlet of old-fashioned houses in this township, called
"Heap Fold," situated on a hill about half a mile west of Heywood.
This hamlet is generally admitted to be the oldest, and,
probably, the only settlement in the township of Heap in the
time of the Saxons, who first cleared and cultivated the land of
the district. Previous to that time, it may be naturally supposed
that, like many other parts of South Lancashire, this district was
overrun with woods, and swamps, and thickets. Edwin Butterworth
published a little pamphlet history of Heywood, from which
I quote the following notes:&mdash;"The origin of the designation
Heap is not at all obvious; in the earliest known mention of the
place, it is termed <i>Hep</i>, which may imply a tract overgrown with
hawthorn berries. The name might arise from the unevenness
of the surface&mdash;<i>heep</i> (Saxon), indicating a mass of irregularities.
The denomination 'Heywood' manifestly denotes the site of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
wood in a field, or a wood surrounded by fields." Farther on,
in the same pamphlet, he says:&mdash;"The local family of Hep, or
Heap, has been extinct a considerable time. The deed of the
gift of the whole forest of Holecombe, to the monks of St. Mary
Magdalen, of Bretton, in Yorkshire, by Roger de Montbegon, is
witnessed, amongst others, by Robert de Hep; but without date,
being of an age prior to the use of dates. Roger de Montbegon,
however, died 10th Henry III., so that this transaction occurred
before 1226." It may be true that what is here alluded to as
the local family of Hep, or Heap, is extinct; but the name of
Heap is now more prevalent among the inhabitants of Heywood
and the immediately surrounding towns than anywhere else in
England. With respect to the two suppositions as to the origin
of the name; almost every Lancashire lad will remember that
he has, at one time or another, pricked his fingers with getting
"heps," the common bright red berry, which, in other parts,
goes by the name of the "hip." And then there is some show
of likelihood in the supposition that the name has come from
the Saxon word "heep," meaning "a mass of irregularities," as
Butterworth says; for the whole district is a succession of hills,
and holes, and undulations, of ever-varying size and shape. Again,
he says, "Heap was doubtless inhabited by at least one Saxon
family, whose descendants, it is probable, quietly conformed to
Norman rule. In that era, or perhaps earlier, the place was
annexed to the lordship and church of Bury, of which Adam de
Bury, and Edward de Buri, were possessors shortly after the conquest.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
A family of the name of Hep, or Heap, held the hamlet
from the paramount lords. In 1311, third of Edward II., Henery
de Bury held one half of the manor of Bury."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Previous to the
fifteenth century, this township must have been part of a very
wild and untempting region, having, for the most part, little or no
settled population, or communion with the living world beyond;
and the progress of population, and cultivation of the land, up
to that time, appear to have been very slow, and only in a few
isolated spots; since, although there were several heys of land at
that time, near to a wood, thence called "Heywood," upon the
spot now occupied by a busy community of people, numbering
twenty thousand at least, yet, there is no record of any dwelling
upon that spot until shortly after the fifteenth century, when a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
few rural habitations were erected thereon. From this comparatively
recent period may be reckoned the dawn of the rural
village which has since expanded into the present manufacturing
town of Heywood, now thriving at a greater rate than ever,
under the impulse of modern industrialism. About this time,
too, began the residence there of a family bearing the local name.
"In 1492 occurs Robert de Heywood. In the brilliant reign of
Elizabeth, Edmund Heywood, Esq., was required, by an order
dated 1574, to furnish a coat of plate, a long bowe, shéffe of
arrows, steel cap, and bill, for the military musters."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> James
Heywood, gentleman, was living before 1604. Peter Heywood,
Esq., a zealous magistrate, the representative of this family in
the reigns of James the I. and Charles the I., was a native and
resident of the present Heywood Hall, which was erected during
the sixteenth century. It is said that he apprehended Guido
Faux, coming forth from the vault of the house of parliament,
on the eve of the gunpowder treason, November 5th, 1605; he
probably accompanied Sir Thomas Knevett, in his search of the
cellars under the parliament house. The principal interest connected
with the earliest history of the town of Heywood seems to
be bound up in the history of Heywood Hall and its inhabitants,
which will be noticed farther on.</p>

<p>The old episcopal chapel, near the market-place, dedicated to
St. Luke, is a plain little building, with nothing remarkable in
its appearance or its situation. It seems to have been founded at
the beginning of the seventeenth century. It contains inscriptions
commemorative of the Holts, of Grizlehurst, and the Starkies, of
Heywood Hall. A dial-plate on the eastern exterior bears the
date of 1686, with the initials of Robert Heywood, Esq., of
Heywood Hall, who was governor of the Isle of Man in 1678.
Besides the Heywoods, of Heywood Hall, there were several
powerful local families in the olden time seated at short distances
round the spot where Heywood now stands: the Heaps, of
Heap; the Bamfords, of Bamford; the Marlands, of Marland;
the Holts, of Grizlehurst; and the Hopwoods, of Hopwood&mdash;which
last still reside upon their ancient estate.</p>

<p>Heywood, or "Monkey Town," as sarcastic people in other
parts of Lancashire sometimes call it, is now a manufacturing
place of at least twenty thousand inhabitants. It owes its rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
almost entirely to the cotton manufacture; and the history of the
latter incorporates the history of the former in a much greater
degree than that of any other considerable town in the district.
This gives it a kind of interest which certainly does not belong
to any beauty the appearance of the town at present possesses.
A few years before those mechanical inventions became known
which ultimately made Lancashire what it is now, Heywood
was a little peaceful country fold; but a few years after
these inventions came into action, it began to grow into
what the people of those days thought "something rich and
strange," with a celerity akin to the growth of great towns
in the United States of America. About two hundred years
ago, a few rural cottages first arose upon this almost unpeopled
spot; and at the time when the manufacture of cotton began
in South Lancashire, it was still a small agricultural village,
prettily situated in a picturesque scene, about the centre of
the ridge of land which is now nearly covered by the present
smoky town. This little nucleus clustered near the old chapel
which stands in the market-place. Previous to the invention
of the fly shuttle, by Kay, in the neighbouring town of
Bury; and the ingenious combinations of the inventions of
his contemporaries by Arkwright, the Preston barber, almost
every farm-house and cottage in this part had the old-fashioned
spinning-wheel and the hand-loom in them, wherewith
to employ any time the inhabitants could spare from their
rural occupations. At the time of Arkwright's first patent, the
people of these parts little knew what a change the time's inventions
were bringing upon their quiet haunts&mdash;still less of the
vast influences which were to arise therefrom, combining to the
accomplishment of incalculable ends; and they were, at first,
slow to wean from their old, independent way of living, partly
by farming and partly by manufacturing labour, which they
could do in their own houses, and at their own leisure. "Manchester
manufacturers are glad," says Arthur Young, in 1770
(the year of Arkwright's first patent), "when bread is dear, for
then the people are forced to work." But though the supply of
yarn in those days was less than the demand, and the people
were not yet draughted away from their old manner of life, they
were caught in the web of that inevitable destiny which will
have its way, in spite of the will of man. The world's Master
had new commissioners abroad for the achievement of new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
purposes. These wonder-working seeds of providence, patiently
developing themselves in secret, were soon to burst forth in a
wide harvest of change upon the field of human life. Certain men
of mechanical genius arose, and their creative dreams wrought
together in a mysterious way to the production of extraordinary
results. John Kay, of Bury, invented the "picking-peg," or
"fly-shuttle," in 1738; and his son, Robert Kay, invented the
"drop-box," used in the manufacture of fabrics of various colours;
and that wonderful cotton and woollen carding machine, which
stretches the wire out of the ring, cuts it into lengths, staples and
crooks it into teeth, pricks holes in the leather, and puts in the
teeth, row after row, with extraordinary speed and precision, till
the cards are finished. Thomas Highs, the humble and ingenious
reed-maker, at Leigh, in 1763, originated that first remarkable
improvement in spinning machinery which he called after his
favourite daughter, "Jenny;" and he also introduced the "throstle,"
or water-frame, in 1767. This man lingered out his old age in
affliction and dependence. James Hargreaves, the carpenter, of
Blackburn, improved upon the original idea of the spinning jenny,
and invented the crank and comb, "an engine of singular merit
for facilitating the progress of carding cotton." The ignorant
jealousy of the Lancashire operatives in those days drove this
ingenious man to seek shelter in Nottinghamshire, where he was
but ill-received, and where he ended his days in poverty. He
died in a workhouse. Arkwright, the Preston barber, was more
endowed by nature with the qualities requisite for worldly success
than these ingenious, abstracted, and simple-minded mechanical
dreamers. He was a man of great perseverance and worldly sagacity.
With characteristic cunning, he appears to have wormed
their secrets out of some of these humble inventors; and then, with
no less industry and enterprise than ingenuity, he combined these
with other kindred inventions, and wrought them into a practical
operation, which, by its results, quickly awakened the world to
a knowledge of their power. He became a rich man, and "Sir
Richard." In 1780, the "spinning mule" was first introduced
by its inventor, Samuel Crompton, a dreamy weaver, then
dwelling in a dilapidated corner of an old Lancashire hall, called
"Th' Hall i'th Wood," in Turton, near Bolton. This machine
united the powers of the spinning jenny and the water frame.
The spinning mule is now in general use in the cotton manufacture.
This poor weaver gave his valuable invention to the public,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
without securing a patent. His remuneration, in the shape of
money, was therefore left to the cold chances of charity. He
was, however, at first, rewarded by a subscription of one
hundred guineas; and, <i>twenty years afterwards</i>, by an additional
subscription of four hundred guineas; and in 1812, parliament
awarded the sum of five thousand pounds to the dreamy old
weaver, in his latter days. In 1785, the first patent for the
power-loom was obtained by the Rev. Edmund Cartwright, of
Kent, who invented it; and, after considerable improvements, it
has at last contributed another great impulse to the manufacturing
power of these districts. Whilst these mechanical agencies
were developing themselves, James Watt was busy with his
steam power; and Brindley, in conjunction with the Duke of
Bridgewater, was constructing his water-ways. They were
all necessary parts of one great scheme of social alteration,
the end of which is not yet. These men were the immediate
sources of the manufacturing power and wealth of Lancashire.
Up rose Arkwright's model mill at Cromford; and the people
of South Lancashire, who were spinning and weaving in
the old way, in their scattered cottages and folds, began
to find themselves drawn by irresistible spells into new combinations,
and new modes of living and working. Their
remote haunts began to resound with the tones of clustering
labour; their quiet rivers, late murmuring clear through silent
vales and cloughs, began to be dotted with mills; and their
little villages shot up into large manufacturing towns. From
1770 to 1788, the use of wool and linen in the spinning of
yarns had almost disappeared, and cotton had become the almost
universal material for employment. Hand wheels were superseded
by common jennies, hand carding by carding engines, and hand
picking<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> by the fly shuttle. From 1778 to 1803 was the golden
age of this great trade; the introduction of mule yarns, assimilated
with other yarns producing every description of goods, gave a
preponderating wealth through the loom. The mule twist being
rapidly produced, and the demand for goods very large, put
all hands in request; and weaver's shops became yearly more
numerous. The remuneration for labour was high, and the
population was in a comfortable condition. The dissolution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
Arkwright's patent in 1785, and the general adoption of mule
spinning in 1790, concurred to give the most extraordinary impetus
to the cotton manufacture. Numerous mills were erected,
and filled with water frames; and jennies and mules were made
and set to work with incredible rapidity.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Heywood had already
risen up, by the previous methods of manufacture, to a place of
about two thousand inhabitants, in the year 1780&mdash;that changeful
crisis of its history when the manufacture of cotton by steam
power first began in the township of Heap, with the erection of
Makin Mill, hard by the north side of Heywood. This mill was
built by the firm of Peel, Yates, and Co., of Bury&mdash;the principal
of which firm was Robert Peel, Esq. (afterwards Sir Robert), and
father of the memorable Sir Robert Peel, late prime minister of
England, whose name is honourably connected with the abolition
of the Corn Laws; a man who won the gratitude of a nation
by daring to turn "traitor" to a great wrong, that he might
help a great right. This mill is now the property of Edmund
Peel, Esq., brother of the late Sir Robert. It stands about half a
mile from Heywood, in a shady clough, and upon the banks of the
river Roch, which rises in the hills on the north-east extremity
of the county, and flows down through the town of Rochdale,
passing through the glen called "Tyrone's Bed;" and through
"Hooley Clough." The river then winds on westward, by the
town of Bury, three miles off. The course of this water is now
well lined with manufacturing power, nearly from its rise to
its embouchure. A stranger may always find the mills of Lancashire
by following the courses of its waters.</p>

<p>Before the factory system arose, when the people of this quarter
did their manufacturing work at their homes&mdash;when they were
not yet brought completely to depend upon manufacture for livelihood,
and when their manner of life was, at least, more natural
and hardy than it became afterwards&mdash;their condition was, morally
and physically, very good, compared with the condition which
the unrestricted factory system led to, in the first rush after
wealth which it awoke; especially in the employment of young
children in mills. The amount of demoralisation and physical
deterioration then entailed upon the population, particularly in
isolated nooks of the country, where public opinion had little
controlling influence upon such mill-owners as happened to possess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
more avarice than humane care for their operative dependents,
must have been great. It was a wild steeple-chase for wealthy
stakes, in which whip and spur were used with little mercy,
and few were willing to peril their chances of the plate by
any considerations for the sufferings of the animal that carried
them. But the condition of the factory operatives, since
the introduction of the Ten Hours' Bill&mdash;and, perhaps, partly
through the earnest public discussions which led to that enactment&mdash;has
visibly begun to improve. Benevolent and just
men, who own mills, have, of their own accord, in many
honourable instances, paid a more liberal attention to the welfare
of their workpeople even than the provisions of the law
demanded: and those mill-owners whose only care for their
operatives was bounded by a desire to wring as much work as
possible out of them for as little pay as possible, were compelled
to fulfil certain humane regulations, which their own sympathies
would have been slow to concede. The hours of factory labour
are now systematically shortened; and the operatives are not even
so drunken, riotous, and ignorant, as when they were wrought
from bed-time to bed-time. Books and schools, and salutary
recreation, and social comfort, are more fashionable among them
than they used to be&mdash;partly because they are more practicable
things to them than before. The mills themselves are now
healthier than formerly; factory labour is restricted to children
of a reasonable age; and elementary education is now, by a
wisdom worthy of extension, administered through the impulse
of the law, to all children of a certain age in factories.</p>

<p>Heywood is altogether of too modern an origin to contain any
buildings interesting to the admirer of ancient architecture. The
only places in Heywood around which an antiquarian would be
likely to linger, with anything like satisfaction, would be the little
episcopal chapel in the market-place, founded in the seventeenth
century; and Heywood Hall, which stands about half a mile
from the town, and of which more anon. With these exceptions,
there is probably not one building in the place two hundred
years old.</p>

<p>The appearance of Heywood, whether seen in detail or as a
whole, presents as complete, unrelieved, and condensed an epitome
of the still-absorbing spirit of manufacture in the region
where it originated, as can be found anywhere in Lancashire.
And, in all its irregular main street consisting of more than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
mile of brick-built shops and cottages&mdash;together with the little
streets and alleys diverging therefrom&mdash;there does not appear
even one modern building remarkable for taste, or for any other
distinguishing excellence, sufficient to induce an ordinary man
to halt and admire it for a minute. There is not even an edifice
characterised by any singularity whatever, calculated to awaken
wonder or curiosity in an ordinary beholder, except its great
square, brick cotton mills, machine shops, and the like; and
when the outside of one of these has been seen, the outside of
the remainder is no novelty. The heights and depths principally
cultivated in Heywood appear to be those of factory chimneys
and coal-pits. Of course, the interiors of the mills teem with
mechanical wonders and ingenuities; and the social life and
characteristics of the population are full of indigenous interest.
But the general exterior of the town exhibits a dull and dusky
succession of manufacturing sameness. Its inns, with one or two
exceptions, look like jerry-shops; and its places of worship like
warehouses. A living writer has said of the place, that it looks
like a great funeral on its way from Bury to Rochdale&mdash;between
which towns it is situated midway. When seen from any
neighbouring elevation, on a dull day, this strong figure hardly
exaggerates the truth. The whole life of Heywood seems to be
governed by the ring of factory bells&mdash;at least, much more than
by any other bells. The very dwelling-houses look as if they,
too, worked in the factories. To persons accustomed to the
quaint prettiness of well-regulated English rural villages, and the
more natural hue and general appearance of the people in such
places, the inhabitants of Heywood would, at first sight, have
somewhat of a sallow appearance, and their houses would appear
to be slightly smeared with a mixture of soot, sperm oil, and cotton
fluz. And, if such observers knew nothing of the real character
and habits of the population, they would be slow to believe them
a people remarkably fond of cleanliness and of homely comfort,
as far as compatible with the nature of their employment. A
close examination of these Heywood cottages would show, however,
that their insides are more clean and comfortable than the
first glance at their outsides might suggest; and would also reveal
many other things not discreditable to the native disposition of
the people who dwell in them. But the architecture and general
characteristics of Heywood, as a town, evince no taste, no refinement,
nor even public spirit of liberality, commensurate with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
wealth and energy. The whole population seems yet too wrapt
in its manufacturing dream, to care much about the general
adornment of the place, or even about any very effective diffusion
of those influences which tend to the improvement of the health
and the culture of the nobler faculties of the people. But
Heywood may yet emerge from its apprenticeship to blind toil;
and, wiping the dust from its eyes, look forth towards things
quite as essential as this unremitting fight for bread for the day.
At present, wherever one wanders among the streets on week-days,
the same manufacturing indications present themselves. It
is plain that its people are nearly all employed in one way,
directly or indirectly. This is suggested, not only by the number
and magnitude of the mills, and the habitations of the people,
but by every movement on the streets. Every vehicle that
passes; every woman and child about the cottages; every lounger
in the market-place tells the same story. One striking feature of
week-day life in Heywood, more completely even than in many
other kindred towns, is the clock-work punctuality with which
the operative crowds rush from the mills, and hurry along the
streets, at noon, to their dinners; sauntering back again in twos
and threes, or speeding along in solitary haste, to get within the
mill-doors in time for that re-awakening boom of the machinery
which is seldom on the laggard side of its appointment. And it
is not only in the dress and manners of this body of factory
operatives&mdash;in their language and deportment, and the prevailing
hue of their countenances&mdash;that the character and influence of
their employment is indicated; but also in a modified variety of
the same features in the remainder of the population, who are
either immediately connected with these operatives, or indirectly
affected by the same manufacturing influences. I have noticed,
however, that factory operatives in country manufacturing towns
like Heywood have a more wholesome appearance, both in dress
and person, than the same class in Manchester. Whether this
arises from any difference in the atmosphere, or from more
healthy habits of factory operatives in the country than those
induced among the same class by the temptations of a town like
Manchester, I cannot say.</p>

<p>In the course of the year, there are two very ancient festivals
kept up, each with its own quaint peculiarities, by the Heywood
people; and commemorated by them with general rejoicing and
cessation from labour. One of these is the "Rush-bearing," held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
in the month of August&mdash;an old feast which seems to have died
out almost everywhere else in England, except in Lancashire.
Here, in Heywood, however, as in many other towns of the
county, this ancient festival is still observed, with two or three
days' holiday and hilarity. The original signification of this
annual "Rush-bearing," and some of the old features connected
with the ceremony, such as the bearing of the rushes, with great
rejoicing, to the church, and the strewing of them upon the
earthen floor of the sacred fane, have long since died out. The
following passage is taken from a poem called "The Village
Festival," written by Elijah Ridings, a living author, of local
celebrity, and is descriptive of the present characteristics of a
Lancashire "Rush-bearing," as he had seen it celebrated in his
native village of Newton, between Manchester and Oldham:&mdash;</p>

<p>The other is a famous old festival here, as well as in the
neighbouring town of Bury. It is a peculiarly local one, also;
for, I believe, it is not celebrated anywhere else in England
except in these two towns. It begins on Mid-Lent Sunday, or
"Simblin-Sunday," as the people of the district call it, from the
name of a spiced cake which is prepared for this feast in great
profusion, and in the making of which there is considerable
expense and rivalry shown. On "Simblin-Sunday," the two
towns of Bury and Heywood swarm with visitors from the
surrounding country, and "simblins" of extraordinary size and
value are exhibited in the shop windows. The festival is kept
up during two or three days of the ensuing week. In the Rev.
W. Gaskell's interesting lectures on the "Lancashire Dialect,"
the following passage occurs relative to this "Simblin-Cake:"&mdash;"As
you are aware there is a kind of cake for which the town of
Bury is famous, and which gives its name in these parts to Mid-Lent
Sunday&mdash;I mean 'symnel.' Many curious and fanciful
derivations have been found for this; but I feel no doubt that
we must look for its true origin to the Anglo-Saxon 'simble' or
'simle,' which means a feast, or 'symblian,' to banquet. 'Simnel'
was evidently some kind of the finest bread. From the chronicle
of Battle Abbey, we learn that, in proof of his regard for the
monks, the Conqueror granted for their daily uses thirty-six
ounces of 'bread fit for the table of a king,' which is called <i>simenel</i>;
and Roger de Hoveden mentions, among the provisions
allowed to the Scotch King, at the Court of England, 'twelve
<i>simenels</i>.' 'Banquet bread,' therefore, would seem to come very
near the meaning of this word. I may just observe in passing,
that the baker's boy who, in the reign of Henry VII., personated
the Earl of Warwick was most likely called 'Lambert Simnel,'
as a sort of nickname derived from his trade."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The amusements, or what may be called the leisure-habits, of
the factory population in Lancashire manufacturing towns are
much alike. Some are sufficiently jaded when their day's work
is done, or are too apathetic by nature to engage heartily in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
anything requiring further exertion of body or mind. There are
many, however, who, when they leave the factory in the evening,
go with a kind of renovating glee to the reading of such books as
opportunity brings within their reach, or to the systematic prosecution
of some chosen study, such as music, botany, mechanics,
or mathematics, which are favourite sciences among the working
people of Lancashire. And even among the humblest there are
often shrewd and well-read, if not extensively-read, politicians,
chiefly of the Cobbett school. But the greatest number occupy
their leisure with rude physical sports, or those coarser indulgences
which, in a place like Heywood, are more easily got at than
books and schools, especially by that part of the people who have
been brought up in toilful ignorance of these elements. The tap-room
is the most convenient school and meeting-place for these;
and the tap-rooms are numerous, and well attended. There,
factory lads congregate nightly, clubbing their pence for cheap
ale, and whiling the night hours away in coarse ribaldry and
dominoes, or in vigorous contention in the art of single step-dancing,
upon the ale-house hearth-stone. This single step-dancing
is a favourite exercise with them; and their wooden clogs are
often very neatly made for the purpose, lacing closely up to
above the ankle, and ornamented with a multitude of bright brass
lace holes. The quick, well-timed clatter upon the tap-room
flags generally tells the whereabouts of such dancing haunts to a
stranger as he goes along the streets; and, if he peeps into one of
them, he may sometimes see a knot of factory lads clustered about
the tap-room door inside, encouraging some favourite caperer
with such exclamations as, "Deawn wi' thi fuut, Robin! Crack
thi rags, owd dog!" The chief out-door sports of the working
class are foot-racing, and jumping matches; and sometimes
foot-ball and cricket. Wrestling, dog-fighting, and cock-fighting
are not uncommon; but they are more peculiar to the hardier
population outside the towns. Now and then, a rough "up-and-down"
fight takes place, at an ale-house door, or brought off,
more systematically, in a nook of the fields. This rude and
ancient manner of personal combat is graphically described
by Samuel Bamford, in his well-known "Passages in the
Life of a Radical." The moors north of Heywood afford
great sport in the grouse season. Some of the local gentry
keep harriers; and now and then, a "foomart-hunt" takes
place, with the long-eared dogs, whose mingled music, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
heard from the hill-sides, sounds like a chime of bells in the
distant valley. The entire population, though engaged in manufacture,
evinces a hearty love of the fields and field sports,
and a strong tincture of the rough simplicity, and idiomatic
quaintness of their forefathers, or "fore-elders," as they often
call them. In an old fold near Heywood, there lived a man a
few years since, who was well known thereabouts as a fighter.
The lads of the hamlet were proud of him as a local champion.
Sometimes he used to call at a neighbouring ale-house, to get a
gill, and have a "bout" with anybody worth the trouble, for
our hero had a sort of chivalric dislike to spending his time on
"wastrils" unworthy of his prowess. When he chanced to be
seen advancing from the distance, the folk in the house used to
say, "Hellho! so-and-so's coming; teen th' dur!" whereupon
the landlord would reply, "Nawe, nawe! lev it oppen, or else
he'll punce it in! But yo'n no casion to be fleyed, for he's as
harmless as a chylt to aught at's wayker nor his-sel!" He is said
to have been a man of few words, except when roused to anger;
when he uttered terrible oaths, with great vehemence. The
people of his neighbourhood say that he once swore so heavily
when in a passion, that a plane-tree, growing at the front of his
cottage, withered away from that hour. Most Lancashire villages
contain men of this stamp&mdash;men of rude, strong frame and temper,
whose habits, manners, and even language, smack a little of the
days of Robin Hood. Yet, it is not uncommon to find them
students of botany and music, and fond of little children. Jane
Clough, a curious local character, died at a great age, near Heywood,
about a year and a half ago. Jane was a notable country
botanist, and she had many other characteristics which made her
remarkable. She was born upon Bagslate Heath, a moorland
tract, up in the hills, to the north-east of Heywood. I well
remember that primitive country amazon, who, when I was a
lad, was such an old-world figure upon the streets of Rochdale
and Heywood. Everybody knew Jane Clough. She was very
tall, and of most masculine face and build of body; with a
clear, healthy complexion. She was generally drest in a strong,
old-fashioned blue woollen bedgown, and thick petticoats of the
same stuff. She wore a plain but very clean linen cap upon her
head, loosely covered with a silk kerchief; and her foot-gear
was heavy clouted shoon, or wooden clogs, suitable to her
rough country walks, her great strength, and masculine habits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Botany was always a ruling passion with old moorland Jane.
She was the queen of all flower-growers in humble life upon
her native ground; especially in the cultivation of the polyanthus,
auricula, tulip, and "ley," or carnation. Jane was well
known at all the flower shows of the neighbourhood, where she
was often a successful exhibitor; and though she was known as
a woman of somewhat scrupulous moral character&mdash;and there
are many anecdotes illustrative of this&mdash;yet she was almost
equally well known at foot-races and dog-battles, or any other
kind of battles; for which she not unfrequently held the stakes.</p>

<p>There used to be many a "hush-shop," or house for the sale
of unlicensed drink, about Heywood; and if the district was
thrown into a riddle, they would turn up, now and then, yet;
especially in the outskirts of the town, and up towards the hills.
These are generally sly spots, where fuddlers, who like ale for its
own sake, can steal in when things are quiet, and get their fill
at something less than the licensed price; or carry off a bottle-full
into the fields, after the gloaming has come on. Of course hush-shop
tipplers could not often indulge in that noisy freedom of
speech, nor in those wild bursts of bacchanalian activity vulgarly
known by the name of "hell's delight," of which licensed ale-houses
are sometimes the scenes; and where the dangerous
Lancashire ale-house game, called "Th' Bull upo' th' Bauk," has
sometimes finished a night of drunken comedy with a touch of
real tragedy. The most suitable customers for the "hush-shop"
were quiet, steady soakers, who cared for no other company
than a full pitcher; and whose psalm of life consisted of
scraps of drinking-songs like the following, trolled out in a
low chuckling tone:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O good ale, thou art my darling,</span><br />
<span class="i0">I love thee night, I love thee morning,</span><br />

<span class="i0">I love thee warm, I love thee cold!</span><br />
<span class="i18">Oh! good ale!</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>There is an old drinking-song just re-published in "The Songs
of the Dramatists," which was printed in 1575, in Bishop Still's
comedy of "Gammer Gurton's Needle," though probably
known earlier. Fragments of this song are still known and
sung in the north of England. The burden runs thus in a
Lancashire version:&mdash;</p>

<p>Having glanced in this brief way at the progress of Heywood,
from the time when it first began to give a human interest to the
locality, as a tiny hamlet, about the end of the fifteenth century,
up to its present condition, as a cotton-spinning town of twenty
thousand inhabitants, surrounded by a district alive with manufacturing
activities, I will return to the narrative of my visit to
the place, as it fell on one fine afternoon about the end of June.</p>

<p>We had come round from the railway station, along the
southern edge of the town, and through the fields, by a footpath
which led us into Heywood about one hundred yards from the
old chapel in the middle of the place. The mills were stopped.
Country people were coming into town to do their errands,
and a great part of the working population appeared to be
sauntering along the main street, stopping at the shops, to make
their markets as they went along; or casting about for their
Saturday night's diversion, and gazing from side to side, to
see what could be seen. Clusters of factory girls were gathered
about the drapers' windows. These girls were generally clean
and tidy; and, not unfrequently, there were very intelligent and
pretty countenances amongst them. The older part of the factory
operatives, both men and women, had often a staid and jaded look.
The shops were busy with customers buying clothing, or food,
or cheap publications; and the ale-houses were getting lively.
A little company of young "factory chaps" were collected about
a bookseller's shop, near the old "Queen Anne," looking out
for news, or pictures; or reading the periodicals exposed in the
windows. Now and then, a select straggler wended his way
across the road to change his "library-book" at the Mechanics'
Institution. There was considerable stir lower down the street,
where a noisy band of music was marching along, followed by
an admiring multitude. And, amongst the whole, a number
of those active, mischief-loving lads, so well known in every
manufacturing town by the name of "doffers," were clattering
about, and darting after one another among the crowd,
as blithe as if they had never known what work was. We
crossed through the middle of the town, and went down the
north road into an open tract of meadow land, towards the
residence of mine host.</p>

<p>The house was pleasantly situated in a garden, about two
stones' throw from the edge of Heywood, in the wide level of
grass land called "Yewood Ho' Greyt Meadow." The road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
goes close by the end of the garden. We entered this garden
by a little side gate, and on we went, under richly-blossomed
apple trees, and across the grass-plat, into the house. The old
housekeeper began to prepare tea for us; and, in the meantime,
we made ourselves at home in the parlour, which looked out
upon the garden and meadows at the front. Mine host sat
down to the piano, and played some of that fine old psalmody
which the country people of Lancashire take such delight in.
His family consisted of himself, a staid-looking old housekeeper,
and his two motherless children. One of these was a timid,
bright-eyed little girl, with long flaxen hair, who, as we came
through the garden, was playing with her hoop upon the
grass-plat, under the blooming apple trees; but who, on seeing a
stranger, immediately sank into a shy stillness. The other was
a contemplative lad, about thirteen, with a Melancthon style of
countenance. I found him sitting in the parlour, absorbed
in "Roderick Random." As soon as tea was over, we went
out in the cool of the evening, to see the daylight die upon the
meadows around. We could hear the stir of Saturday night
life in the town. Through the parlour window we had caught
glimpses of the weird flittings of a large bat; and, as we stood
bare-headed in the garden, it still darted to and fro about the
eaves, in dusky, vivid motions. As the cool night stole on,
we went in, and the shutters closed us from the scene. We
lingered over supper, talking of what newspaper writers call
"the topics of the day," and of books, and local characters
and customs; and about half an hour before midnight we
crept off to bed.</p>

<p>When I rose from bed, and looked through the window of
my chamber, the rich haze of a cloudless midsummer morning
suffused the air. The sunshine lay glittering all over the dewy
fields; for the fiery steeds of Ph&oelig;bus had not yet drunk up
those springs "on chaliced flowers that lie." The birds had
been up many an hour, and were carolling and chirping gleefully
about the eaves of the house, and in the gardens. The
splendour of the day had touched even the dull town on the
opposite ridge with its beautifying magic; and Heywood seemed
to rest from its labours, and rejoice in the gladness which
clothed the heavens and the earth. The long factory chimneys,
which had been bathing their smokeless tops all night in the
cool air, now looked up serenely through the sunshine at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
blue sky, as if they, too, were glad to get rid of the week-day
fume, and gaze quietly again upon the loveliness of nature; and
all the whirling spinning machinery of the town was lying still
and silent as the over-arching heavens. Another Sabbath had
dawned upon the world; and that day of God, and god of days,
was breathing its balm among the sons of toil once more.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Man has another day to swell the past,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And lead him near to little, but his last;</span><br />

</div></div>

<p>It was a feast to the senses and to the soul to look round upon
such a scene at such a time, with the faculties fresh from
repose, and conscious of reprieve from that relentless round
of necessities that follow them, hot-foot, through the rest of the
week. As I dressed myself, I heard mine host's little daughter
begin to play "Rosseau's Dream," in the parlour below, and I
went down stairs humming a sort of accompaniment to the tune;
for it is a sweet and simple melody, which chimed well with
the tone of the hour. The shy musician stayed her fingers, and
rose timidly from her seat, as I entered the room; but a little
coaxing induced her to return to it, and she played the tune over
and over again for us, whilst the morning meal was preparing.
Breakfast was soon over, and the youngsters dressed themselves
for chapel, and left us to ourselves; for the one small bell of
Heywood chapel was going "Toll&mdash;toll&mdash;toll;" and straggling
companies of children were wending up the slope from the
fields towards their Sunday schools. Through the parlour window,
I watched these little companies of country children&mdash;so
fresh, so glad, and sweet-looking&mdash;and as they went their way,
I thought of the time when I, too, used to start from home
on a Sunday morning, dressed in my holiday suit, clean as a
new pin from top to toe; and followed to the door with a
world of gentle admonitions. I thought of some things I learned
"while standing at my mother's knee;" of the little prayer and
the blessing at bed time; of the old solemn tunes which she
used to sing when all the house was still, whilst I sat and listened,
drinking in those plaintive strains of devotional melody, never
to forget them more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>We were now alone in the silent house, and there was a
Sabbatical stillness all around. The sunshine gleamed in at the
windows and open doors; and, where we sat, we could smell
the odours of the garden, and hear the birds outside. We walked
forth into the garden, among beds of flowers, and blooming
apple trees. We could hear the chirrup of children's voices,
still, going up the road, towards the town. From the woods
round Heywood Hall, there came over the meadows a thrilling
flood of music from feathered singers, sporting in those leafy
shades. All nature was at morning service: and it was good to
listen to this general canticle of praise to Him "whose service
is perfect freedom." A kind of hushed joy seemed to pervade
the landscape, which did not belong to any other day, however
fine&mdash;as if the hills and vales knew it was Sunday. To the
wisest men, the whole universe is one place of worship, and the
whole course of human life a divine service. The man who
has a susceptible heart, and loves nature, will find renovation
in communion with her, no matter what troubles may disturb
him in the world of man's life:&mdash;</p>

<p>The back yard of the house, in which we were sauntering,
was divided from the woods of Heywood Hall by a wide level
of rich meadows; and the thick foliage which lapped the
mansion from view, looked an inviting shelter from the heat
of a cloudless midsummer forenoon&mdash;a place where we could
wander about swardy plots and lawns, among embowered nooks
and mossy paths&mdash;bathing in the coolness of green shades, in
which a multitude of birds were waking the echoes with
a sweet tumult of blending melodies. Being disposed for a
walk, we instinctively took the way thitherward. The high
road from the town goes close by the front gates of the
hall. This road was formerly lined by a thick grove of trees,
called "Th' Lung Nursery," reaching nearly from the edge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
of the village to the gates. The grove so shut out the view,
and overhung each side of the way, that the walk between looked
lonely after dark; and country folk, who had been loitering
late over their ale, in Heywood, began to toot from side to
side, with timid glances, and stare with fear at every rustle of
the trees, when they came to "Th' Lung Nursery." Even if
two were in company, they hutched closer together as they approached
this spot, and began to be troubled with vivid remembrances
of manifold past transgressions, and to make internal
resolutions to "Fear God, an' keep th' co'sey," thenceforth, if
they could only manage to "hit th' gate" this once, and get safely
through the nursery, and by the water-stead in Hooley Clough,
where "Yewood Ho' Boggart comes a-suppin' i'th deeod time
o'th neet." This road was then, also, flanked on each side by a
sprawling thorn-edge, overgrown with wild mint, thyme, and
nettles; and with thistles, brambles, stunted hazles, and wild rose
bushes; with wandering honeysuckles weaving about through
the whole. It was full of irregular dinges, and "hare-gates,"
and holes, from which clods had been riven; and perforated by
winding tunnels and runs, where the mole, the weasel, the field-mouse,
and the hedgehog wandered at will. Among the thorns
at the top, there was many an erratic, scratchy breach, the
result of the incursions of country herbalists, hunters, bird-nesters,
and other roamers of the woods and fields. It was
one of those old-fashioned hedges which country lads delight in;
where they could creep to and fro, in a perfect revel of freedom
and fun, among brushwood and prickles, with no other impediment
than a wholesome scratching; and where they could fight
and tumble about gloriously, among nettles, mint, mugwort,
docks, thistles, sorrel, "Robin-run-i'th-hedge," and a multitude
of other wild herbs and flowers, whose names and virtues it
would puzzle even a Culpepper to tell; rough and free as so
many snod-backed modiwarps&mdash;ripping and tearing, and soiling
their "good clooas," as country mothers used to call them, by
tumbling among the dry soil of the hedge-side, and then rolling
slap into the wet ditch at the bottom, among "cuckoo-spit," and
"frog-rud," and all sorts of green pool-slush; to the dismay of
sundry limber-tailed "Bull-Jones," and other necromantic fry
that inhabit such stagnant moistures. Some looked for nests,
and some for nuts, while others went rustling up the trees, trying
the strength of many a bough; and all were blithe and free as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
the birds among the leaves, until the twilight shades began to
fall. Whilst the sun was still in the sky, they thought little
about those boggarts, and "fairees," and "feeorin'," which,
according to local tradition, roam the woods, and waters, and
lonely places; sometimes with the malevolent intent of luring
into their toil any careless intruder upon their secluded domain.
Some lurking in the streams and pools, like "Green Teeth," and
"Jenny Long Arms," waiting, with skinny claws, for an opportunity
to clutch the wanderer upon the bank into the water.
Others, like "Th' White Lady," "Th' Skrikin' Woman,"
"Baum Rappit," "Grizlehurst Boggart," and "Clegg Ho'
Boggart," haunting lonely nooks of the green country, and old
houses, where they have made many a generation of simple folk
pay a toll of superstitious fear for some deed of darkness done
in the dim past. Others, like "Nut Nan," prowling about
shady recesses of the woods, "wi' a poke-full o' red-whot
yetters, to brun nut-steylers their e'en eawt." But, when dusky
evening began to steal over the fading scene, and the songs of
birds, and all the sounds of day began to die upon the ear&mdash;when
the droning beetle, and the bat began to flit about;
and busy midges danced above the road, in mazy eddies, and
spiral columns, between the eye and the sky; then the superstitious
teachings of their infancy began to play about the mind;
and, mustering their traps, the lads turned their feet homeward,
tired, hungry, scratched, dirty, and pleased; bearing away with
them&mdash;in addition to sundry griping feeds of unripe dogberry,
which they had eaten from the hedge-sides&mdash;great store of hazlenuts,
and earth-nuts; hips and haws; little whistles, made of
the bark of the wicken tree; slips of the wild rose, stuck
in their caps and button-holes; yellow "skedlocks," and whiplashes
made of plaited rushes; and sometimes, also, stung-up eyes
and swollen cheeks, the painful trophies of encounters with the
warlike inhabitants of "wasp-nests," unexpectedly dropped on,
in the course of their frolic.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh! sweet youth; how soon it fades;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sweet joys of youth, how fleeting!</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>The road home was beguiled with clod-battles, "Frog-leap," and
"Bob Stone," finishing with "Trinel," and "High Cockolorum,"
as they drew near their quarters. The old hedge and the nursery
have been cleared away, and now the fertile meadows lie open
to the view, upon each side of the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>On arriving at the entrance which leads to Heywood Hall,
we turned in between the grey gate-pillars. They had a lone
and disconsolate appearance. The crest of the Starkies is gone
from the top; and the dismantled shafts look conscious of
their shattered fortunes. The wooden gate&mdash;now ricketty
and rotten&mdash;swung to and fro with a grating sound upon
its rusty hinges, as we walked up the avenue of tall trees,
towards the hall. The old wood was a glorious sight, with
the flood of sunshine stealing through its fretted roof of
many-patterned foliage, in freakish threads and bars, which
played beautifully among the leaves, weaving a constant interchange
of green and gold within that pleasant shade, as the
plumage of the wood moved with the wind. The scene reminded
me of a passage in Spencer's "Faëry Queene:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And all within were paths and alleies wide,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With footing worne and leading inward farre:</span><br />
<span class="i0">Faire harbour that them seems: so in they entred ar.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>We went on under the trees, along the carriage road, now tinged
with a creeping hue of green; and past the old garden, with its
low, bemossed brick wall; and, after sauntering to and fro
among a labyrinth of footpaths, which wind about the cloisters
of this leafy cathedral, we came to the front of the hall. It
stands tenantless and silent in the midst of its ancestral woods,
upon the brow of a green eminence, overlooking a little valley,
watered by the Roch. The landscape was shut out from
us by the surrounding trees; and the place was as still as a
lonely hermitage in the heart of an old forest. The tread of our
feet upon the flagged terrace in front of the mansion resounded
upon the ear. We peeped through the windows, where the
rooms were all empty; but the state of the walls and floors, and
the remaining mirrors, showed that some care was still bestowed
upon this deserted hall. Ivy hung thickly upon some parts of the
straggling edifice, which has evidently been built at different
periods; though, so far as I could judge, the principal part of it
appears to be about two hundred years old. When manufacture
began greatly to change the appearance of the neighbouring
village and its surrounding scenery, the Starkies left the place;
and a wooded mound, in front of the hall, was thrown up and
planted, by order of the widow of the last Starkie who resided
here, in order to shut from sight the tall chimneys which were
rising up in the distance. A large household must have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
kept here in the palmy days of the Starkies. The following
passage, relative to the ancient inhabitants of Heywood Hall, is
quoted from Edwin Butterworth's "History of the Town of
Heywood and its Vicinity:"&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A family bearing this name flourished here for many generations; but they were
never of much note in county genealogy, though more than one were active in public
affairs. In 1492 occurs Robert de Heywode. In the brilliant reign of Elizabeth,
Edmund Heywood, Esq., was required, by an order dated 1574, to furnish "a coate
of plate, a long bowe, sheffe of arrows, steel cap, and bill, for the military musters."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
James Heywood, gent., was living before 1604. Peter Heywood, Esq., a zealous
magistrate, the representative of this family in the reigns of James the First and
Charles the First, was a native and resident of Heywood hall, which was erected
during the sixteenth century. It is said that he apprehended Guido Faux coming
forth from the vault of the house of parliament on the eve of the gunpowder treason,
Nov. 5, 1605. He probably accompanied Sir Thomas Kneuett, in his search of the
cellars under the parliament house. In 1641, "an order was issued that the justices
of the peace of Westminster should carefully examine what strangers were lodged
within their jurisdiction; and that they should administer the oaths of allegiance and
supremacy to all suspected of recusancy, and proceed according to those statutes.
An afternoon being appointed for that service in Westminster hall, and many persons
warned to appear there, amongst the rest one &mdash;&mdash; James, a Papist, appeared, and
being pressed by Mr. Hayward (Heywood), a justice of the peace, to take the oaths,
suddenly drew out his knife and stabbed him; with some reproachful words, 'for
persecuting poor Catholics.' This strange, unheard-of outrage upon the person of a
minister of justice, executing his office by an order of parliament, startled all men;
the old man sinking with the hurt, though he died not of it. And though, for aught
I could ever hear, it proceeded only from the rage of a sullen varlet (formerly suspected
to be crazed in his understanding), without the least confederacy or combination
with any other, yet it was a great countenance to those who were before thought
over apprehensive and inquisitive into dangers; and made many believe it rather a
design of all the Papists of England, than a desperate act of one man, who could
never have been induced to it, if he had not been promised assistance by the rest,"<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
Such is Lord Clarendon's account of an event that has rendered Peter Heywood a
person of historical note; how long he survived the attempt to assassinate him is
not stated.</p>

<p>It is highly probable that Mr. Heywood had imbibed an undue portion of that
anti-Catholic zeal which characterised the times in which he lived, and that he was
the victim of those rancorous animosities which persecution never fails to engender.</p>

<p>Peter Heywood, of Heywood, Esq., was one of the gentlemen of the county who
compounded for the recovery of their estates, which had been sequestrated 1643-5,
for supporting the royal cause. He seems to have been a son of the Mr. Heywood
that was stabbed; he re-obtained his property for the sum of &pound;351.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The next of this family on record is Peter <i>Heiwood</i>, Esq., who was one of the
"counsellors of Jamaica" during the commonwealth. One of his sons, Peter <i>Heiwood</i>,
Esq., was commemorated by an inscription on a flat stone in the chancel of
the church of St. Anne's-in-the-Willows, Aldersgate-ward, London, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Peter Heiwood, that deceased Nov. 2, 1701, younger son of Peter Heiwood,
one of the counsellours of Jamaica, by Grace, daughter of Sir John Muddeford,
Knight and Baronet, great grandson to Peter Heywood, in the county palatine of
Lancaster; who apprehended Guy Faux with his dark lanthorn; and for his zealous
prosecution of Papists, as justice of peace, was stabbed in Westminster hall, by John
James, Dominican friar, anno. domini. 1640.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>
<p>Robert Heywood, of Heywood, Esq., married Mary Haslam, of Rochdale, Dec.
20, 1660; and was probably elder brother of Peter <i>Heiwood</i>, of London.</p>

<p>In the visitation of 1664, are traced two lines of the Heywoods, those of Heywood
and Walton; from the latter was descended Samuel Heywood, Esq., a Welch
judge,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> uncle of Sir Benjamin Heywood, Baronet, of Claremont, near Manchester.
The armorial bearing of the Heywoods, of Heywood, was argent, three torteauxes,
between two bendlets gules.</p>

<p>The property of this ancient family, principally consisting of Heywood Hall and
adjoining lands, is said to have been purchased by Mr. John Starkey, of the
Orchard, in Rochdale, in the latter part of the seventeenth or the beginning of the
eighteenth century. Mr. Starkey was living in 1719; his descendant, John Starkey,
Esq., married Mary, daughter of Joseph Gregge, Esq., of Chamber Hall, Oldham.
John Starkey, Esq., who died March 13, 1780, was father of James Starkey, Esq., of
Fell Foot, near Cartmel, Lancashire, the present possessor of Heywood Hall, born
September 8, 1762, married, September 2, 1785, Elizabeth, second daughter of Edward
Gregg Hopwood, Esq. In 1791, Mr. Starkey served the office of high sheriff of the
county. From this family branched the Starkeys of Redivals, near Bury.</p></blockquote>

<p>Heywood looks anything but picturesque, at present; but,
judging from the features of the country about the hall,
especially on the north side of it, this house must have been
a very pleasant and retired country seat about a century and
a half ago.</p>

<p>Descending from the eminence, upon the northern edge of
which Heywood Hall is situated,&mdash;and which was probably
the first inhabited settlement hereabouts, at a time when the
ground now covered by the manufacturing town, was a
tract of woods and thickets, wild swards, turf moss, and
swamps&mdash;we walked westward, along the edge of the Roch,
towards the manufacturing hamlet of Hooley Bridge. This
valley, by the water-side, has a sylvan and cultivated appearance.
The quiet river winds round the pastures of the hall,
which slope down to the water, from the shady brow upon
which it stands. The opposite heights are clad with woods and
plantations; and Crimble Hall looks forth from the lawns and
gardens upon the summit. About a mile up this valley, towards
Rochdale town, in a quiet glen, lies the spot pointed out in
Roby's "Tradition" of "Tyrone's Bed," as the place where the
famous Irish rebel, Hugh O'Niel, Earl of Tyrone, lived in
concealment some time, during the reign of Elizabeth. Even
at this day, country folks, who know little or nothing of the
tradition, know the place by the name of "Yel's o' Thorone"&mdash;an
evident corruption of the "Earl of Tyrone." This was
the Irish chieftain who burnt the poet Spenser out of his residence,
Rathcormac Castle. It was dinner time when we reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
the stone bridge at Hooley Clough; so we turned up the road
towards home.</p>

<p>The youngsters and the dinner were waiting for us, when
we got back to the house. The little girl was rather more communicative
than before; and, after the meal was over, we had
more music. But, while this was going on, the lad stole away to
some nook, with a book in his hand. And, soon after, the master
of the house and I found ourselves again alone, smoking and
talking together. I had enjoyed this summer day so far, and was
inclined to make the most of it; so, when dinner was over, I went
out at the back, and down by a thorn-edge, which divides the
meadows. I was soon followed by mine host, and we sauntered
on together till we came to a shelving hollow, in which a still
pool lay gleaming like a sun among the meadows. It looked
cool, and brought the skies to our feet. Sitting down upon
its bank, we watched the reflection of many a straggling
cloud of gauzy white, sailing over its surface, eastward. Little
fishes, leaping up now and then, were the only things which
stirred the burnished mirror, for a second or two, into tiny
tremulations of liquid gold; and water-flies darted to and
fro upon the pool, like nimble fancies in a fertile mind.
And thus we lazily enjoyed the glory of a summer day in
the fields; while</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The lark was singing in the blinding sky,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And hedges were white with may.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>After awhile, we drifted dreamily asunder, and I crept under
the shade of a fence hard by, to avoid the heat; and there
lay on my back, looking towards the sky, through my fingers,
to keep sight of a fluttering spot from which a skylark poured
down its rain of melody upon the fields around. My face
was half buried in grass and meadow herbs; and I fell asleep
with them peeping about my eye-lids. After half an hour's
dreamy doze in the sun&mdash;during which my mind seemed to
have acted over a whole lifetime in masquerade&mdash;I woke up,
and, shaking the buzz of field-flies out of my ears, we gathered
up our books, and went into the house.</p>

<p>When it drew towards evening, we left the house again&mdash;for
it was so fine outside, that it seemed a pity to remain
under cover longer than necessary&mdash;and we walked through
the village in Hooley Clough, and on, northward, up hill,
and down dell, until we came to a wild upland, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
"Birtle," which stretches away along the base of Ashworth
Moor. The sun was touching the top of the hills when we
reached that elevated tract; and the western heavens were
glowing with the grandeur of his decline as we walked across
the fields towards an old hamlet called "Grislehurst." Here
we stayed a while, conversing with an ancient cottager and his
dame, about the history of their native corner, its legendary
associations, and other matters interesting to them and to us.
We left Grislehurst in the twilight, by a route which led
through the deeps of Simpson Clough, and on, homewards,
just as the first lamps of evening were lighting up; rejoicing in
the approach of a cloudless summer night, as we had rejoiced
in the glorious day which had gone down.</p>

<p>The next morning, I returned to Manchester; and, since
that time, it has often been a pleasure to me in the crowded
city to recollect that summer day, spent in the country
north of the town of Heywood. Its images never return to
my memory but I wish to hold them there awhile. Emerson
says:&mdash;"Give me health and a day, and I will make the
pomp of emperors ridiculous. The dawn is my Assyria;
the sunset and moonrise my Paphos, and unimaginable realms
of faërie; broad noon shall be my England of the senses and the
understanding; the night shall be my Germany of mystic philosophy
and dreams." If men had their eyes open to the beauties
and uses of those elements which are open to all alike, and
felt the grandeur of this earth, which is the common home of the
living, how much would it reconcile them to their differences of
position, and moderate their repinings at the superiority of this
man's housing, and that man's dress and diet.</p>

<p>Looking back at the present character and previous history
of this town of Heywood, there is some suggestive interest
in both the one and the other. The period of its existence&mdash;from
the time when it first arose, in an almost uncultivated
spot, as an habitation of man, till now&mdash;is contained in
such a brief space, that to any man who cares to consider
the nature of its origin, and the character of the influences
which have combined to make it such as it now is, the
materials for guiding him to a comprehension of these things, lie
almost as much within his reach as if the place were a plant
which he had put into the soil for himself, and the growth of
which he had occasionally watched with interest. In this respect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
although Heywood wears much the same general appearance as
other cotton-spinning towns, it has something of a character
of its own, different from most of those towns of Lancashire,
whose histories go back many centuries, often through eventful
changes, till they grow dim among the early records of
the kingdom in general. Unlike those, however, Heywood is
almost entirely the creation of the cotton trade, which itself
arose out of the combination of a few ingenious thoughts put
into practice by a people who seem to have been eminently fitted
by nature to perceive their value, and to act enterprisingly upon
what they perceived. If it had been possible for an intelligent
man to have lifted himself into mid air above Heywood, about
two hundred years ago, when its first cottages began to cluster
into a little village, and to settle himself comfortably upon a
cloud, so as to be able to watch the growth of the place
below, with all the changing phases of its life from then till
now, it might present to him a different aspect, and lead him to
different conclusions to those engendered by people living and
moving among the swarms of human action. In the mind of
such a serene overlooker&mdash;distinctly observing the detail and
the whole of the manner of life beneath him, and fully comprehending
the nature of the rise and progress of this Lancashire
town&mdash;many thoughts might arise, which would not occur to
those who creep about the crowded earth, full of little perturbations.
But, to almost any thoughtful man, the history
of this manufacturing town would illustrate the power which
a little practical knowledge gives to a practical people over
the physical elements of creation, as well as over that portion
of the people who have little or no education, and are,
therefore, drifted hither and thither by every wind of circumstance
which wafts across the surface of society. It might
suggest, too, how much society is indebted, for whatever force
or excellence there is in it, to the scattered seeds of silent thought
which have quietly done their work among the noise of action&mdash;for
ever leading it on to still better action; and it might suggest
how much the character of the next generation depends upon
the education of the present one. Looking at this question of
education merely in that point of view in which it affects production,
the following passage, by an eminent advocate of education,
shall speak for itself:&mdash;"Prior to education, the productive
power of the six millions of workers in the United Kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
would be the physical force which they were capable of exerting.
In the present day, the power really exerted is equal to the force
of a hundred millions of men at least. But the power of the uneducated
unit is still the physical force of one man, the balance
being exerted by men who understand the principles of mechanics
and of chemistry, and who superintend the machine power evolved
thereby. Thus the power originated by the few, and superintended
by a fraction of society, is seventeen times greater than the strength
of all our workers, and is hourly increasing." If a man was a pair
of steam looms, how carefully would he be oiled, and tended, and
mended, and made to do all that a pair of looms could do. What
a loom, full of miraculous faculties is he, compared to these&mdash;the
master-piece of nature for creative power, and for wonderful
variety of capabilities! yet, with what a profuse neglect he is
cast away, like the cheapest rubbish on earth!</p>

<p class="drop-capi1"><span class="smcap">When</span> one gets a few miles off any of the populous towns
in Lancashire, many an old wood, many a lonesome
clough, many a quiet stream and ancient building, is
the reputed haunt of some local sprite, or "boggart,"
or is enveloped in an atmosphere of dread by the superstitions
of the neighbourhood, as being the resort of fairies, or
"feeorin."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> This is frequently the case in retired vales and
nooks lying between the towns. But it is particularly so
in the hilly parts, where the old manners of the people are
little changed, and where many homelets of past ages still
stand in their old solitudes, and&mdash;like their sparse population&mdash;retain
many of their ancient characteristics. In such places, the
legends and superstitions of the forefathers of Lancashire are
cherished with a tenacity which would hardly be credible to the
inhabitants of great cities in these days. There, still lingers the
belief in witchcraft, and in the power of certain persons to do ill,
through peculiar connection with the evil one; and the belief,
also, that others&mdash;known as "witch-doctors"&mdash;are able to "rule
the spells," or counteract the malign intents of necromancy; and
possess secret charms which afford protection against the foul
fiend and all his brood of infernal agencies.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>
<p>A few years ago, I lived at an old farm, called "Peanock,"
up in the hills, towards Blackstone Edge. At that time, a strong
little fellow about twenty-three years of age, called "Robin,"
was employed as "keaw-lad" at the farm. Robin used to tell
me tales of the witches and boggarts of the neighbourhood.
The most notable one of them all was "Clegg Ho' Boggart,"
which is commemorated by the late Mr. John Roby, in his
"Traditions of Lancashire." This local sprite is still the
theme of many a winter's tale, among the people of the hills
about Clegg Hall. The proverb "Aw'm here again&mdash;like Clegg
Ho' Boggart," is common there, and in the surrounding towns
and villages. I remember Robin saying that when he had to go
into the "shippon" early on a winter's morning, with a light, he
used to advance his lantern and let it shine a minute or two into
the "shippon" before he durst enter himself, on account of the
"feeorin" which "swarmed up and deawn th' inside i'th neet
time." But he said that "things o' that mak couldn't bide leet,"
for, as soon as his lantern glinted into the place, he could see
"witches scuttering through th' slifters o'th wole, by theawsans,
like bits o' leet'nin." He used to tell me, too, that a dairy-lass
at a neighbouring farm had to let go her "churn-pow,"
because "a rook o' little green divuls begun a-swarmin up th'
hondle, as hoo wur churnin'." And then he would glance, with
a kind of unconscious timidity, towards a nook of the yard,
where stood three old cottages connected with the farm; and in
one of which there dwelt an aged man, of singular habits and
appearance, of whose supposed supernatural powers most of the
people of that neighbourhood harboured a considerable degree of
fear; and, as he glanced towards the corner of the building, he
would tell me in an under tone that the Irish cow, "Red
Jenny," which used to be "as good a keaw as ever whiskt a
tail, had never lookt up sin' owd Bill glented at hur through
a hole i'th shippon wole, one mornin, as Betty wur milkin
hur." Prejudices of this kind are still common in thinly-peopled
nooks of the Lancashire hills. "Boggarts" appear,
however, to have been more numerous than they are now,
when working people wove what was called "one lamb's
wool" in a day; but when it came to pass that they had
to weave "three lambs' wools" in a day, and the cotton trade
arose, boggarts, and fairies, and "feeorin" of all kinds, began
to flee away from the clatter of shuttles, and the tired weaver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
was fain to creep from his looms to bed, where he could rest his
body, and weave his fearful fancies into the freakish pattern
of a dream. And then, railway trains began to rumble hourly
through solitudes where "the little folk" of past days had held
undisturbed sway; and perhaps these helped to dispel some of
those dreams of glamour which had been fostered by the
ignorance of the past.</p>

<p>Far on in the afternoon of a summer day, I sat at tea with an
acquaintance who dwells in the fields outside the town of Heywood.
We had spent the forenoon in visiting Heywood Hall,
and rambling among its woods, and through a pleasant clough,
which winds along the northern base of the eminence on which
that old mansion stands. We lingered over the afternoon meal,
talking of the past and present of the district around us. We
speculated upon the ancient aspect of the country, and the condition
and characteristics of its early inhabitants; we talked of
the old local gentry, their influence, their residences, and their
fortunes; of remarkable local scenes, and men; and of the present
features of life in these districts. Part of our conversation
related to the scenery of that tract of hills and cloughs which
comprises the country, rising, northward, from Heywood up
to the lofty range of moorlands which divides that part of
Lancashire from Rossendale Forest. Up in this remote tract,
there is a solitary hamlet, called Grislehurst. To a stranger's
eye, the two quaint farmsteads, which are now the sole relics of
the hamlet, would be interesting, if only on account of the
retired beauty of their situation, and the romantic character of the
scenery around. Grislehurst stands on an elevated platform of
land, called "Birtle," or "Birkle," the place of birches. It is
bounded on the north by the ridge of Ashworth moor, and the
lofty mass of Knowl hill; and on the east by Simpson Clough,
a deep ravine, about two miles long, running up into the hills.
This glen of precipitous crags, and wood-shrouded waters,
is chiefly known to those who like rough and lonesome country
walks; and to anybody who loves to ramble among such
legend-haunted solitudes, a moonlight walk through "Simpson
Clough" would be a pleasure not easily forgotten. Grislehurst
stands about a stone's throw from the western brink of the
clough, and out of the way of common observation. But it is
not only the lone charm of its situation which makes this hamlet
interesting. Grislehurst is a settlement of the early inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
of the district; and was for some centuries one of the seats of the
Holt family, of Grislehurst, Stubley, and Castleton, in this parish;
a branch of the Holts of Sale, Ashton, Cheshire. Some of this
family fought in the Scottish wars, and also in favour of the royal
cause, at Edgehill, Newberry, Marston Moor, &amp;c., and were
named in King Charles's projected order of the Royal Oak.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
There was a Judge Holt, of the Holts of Sale; and a James Holt,
whose mother was co-heiress to Sir James de Sutton; he was killed
at Flodden Field. Mary, the daughter of James Holt, the last of
the family who resided at Castleton Hall, in this parish, married
Samuel, brother of Humphrey Cheetham. The manor of Spotland
was granted by Henry VIII. to Thomas Holt, of Grislehurst,
who was knighted in Scotland, by Edward, Earl of Hertford, in
the thirty-sixth year of the reign of that monarch. The Holts
were the principal landowners in the parish of Rochdale at the
close of the sixteenth century. What remains of Grislehurst is
still associated in the mind with the historic interest which
attaches to this once powerful local family. The place is also
closely interwoven with some other ancient traditions of the
locality, oral and written.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> In earlier years, I have often wandered
about the woods, and waters, and rocky recesses of this
glen, thinking of the tale of the rebel Earl,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> who is said to have
concealed himself, two centuries ago, in a neighbouring clough
which bears his name; and, wrapt in a dreamland of my own,
sometimes a little tinctured with the wizard lore which lingers
among the primitive folk of that quarter. But, in all my walks
thereabouts, I had never visited Grislehurst, till this summer afternoon,
when, as we sat talking of the place, my curiosity impelled
me to propose an evening ramble to the spot; from which we
could return, by another route, through Simpson Clough.</p>

<p>We were not quite half an hour's walk from Grislehurst when
we started on the north road from Heywood; and the sun was
still up in the heavens. Half a mile brought us into Hooley
Clough, where the road leads through the village of Hooley
Bridge. This village lines the opposite banks of the Roch at
that place. Its situation is retired and picturesque. The vale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
in which it lies is agreeably adorned with plantations, and the
remains of old woods; and the whole scenery is green and
pleasant. The village itself has a more orderly and wholesome
appearance than any other manufacturing hamlet which I
remember. The houses were clean and comfortable-looking, and
the roads in fair condition. I noticed that nearly every cottage
had its stock of coals piled up under the front window, and open
to the street; the "cobs" nearly built up into a square wall,
and the centre filled up with the "sleck an' naplins." It struck
me that if the people of Manchester were to leave their coals thus
free to the world, the course of a single night would "leave not
a wreck behind." The whole population of the place is employed
by the Fenton family, whose mills stand close to the margin of
the river, in the hollow of the clough.</p>

<p>We went up the steep cart road leading out of Hooley Clough
towards the north, emerging into the highway from Bury to
Rochdale, about a quarter of a mile from the lower end of
Simpson Clough, and nearly opposite the lodge of Bamford Hall.
The country thereabouts is broken into green hills and glens,
with patches of old woods, shading the sides of the cloughs. It
is bleak and sterile in some parts, and thinly populated, over the
whole tract, up to the mountainous moors. As we descended the
highway into Simpson Clough, through an opening in the trees,
we caught a glimpse of "Makin mill," low down in a green
valley to the west. This old mill was the first cotton factory
erected in the township of Heap. It was built about 1780, by
the firm of Peel, Yates, and Co., and now belongs to Edmund
Peel, Esq., brother to the late prime minister. Looking over the
northern parapet of the bridge, in the hollow of the road, the
deep gully of the clough is filled with a cluster of mills, and the
cottages attached to them. Woody heights rise abruptly around,
and craggy rocks over-frown this little nest of manufacture, in
the bottom of the ravine. We climbed up the steep road, in the
direction of Bury, and on reaching the summit, at a place called
"Th' Top o'th Wood," we turned off at the end of a row of
stone cottages, and went to the right, on a field-path which leads
to Grislehurst. Half a mile's walk brought us to two old
farm-houses, standing a little apart. We were at a loss to know
which of the two, or whether either of them belonged to Grislehurst
Hall. The largest took our attention most, on account of
some quaint, ornamental masonry built up in its walls; though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
evidently not originally belonging to the building. We went
round to look at the other side, where similar pieces of ancient
masonry were incorporated. The building, though old, was too
modern, and had too much barn-like plainness about it to be the
hall of the Holts. And then, the country around was all green
meadow and pasture; and if this building was not Grislehurst
Hall, there was none. I began to think that the land was the
most remarkable piece of antiquity about the place. But one
part of the west side of this building formed a comfortable
cottage residence, the window of which was full of plants, in
pots. An hale old man, bareheaded, and in his shirt-sleeves,
leaned against the door-cheek, with his arms folded. He was
short and broad-set, with fresh complexion and bright eyes; and
his firm full features, and stalwart figure, bespoke a life of healthy
habits. He wore new fustian breeches, tied with black silk ribbon
at the knees. Leaning there, and looking calmly over the fields in
the twilight, he eyed us earnestly, as country folk do when strangers
wander into their lonely corners. The soft summer evening
was sinking beautifully on the quiet landscape, which stretches
along the base of Ashworth moor. The old man's countenance
had more of country simplicity than force of character in
it; yet he was very comely to look upon, and seemed a natural
part of the landscape around him; and the hour and the man
together, somehow, brought to my mind a graphic line in the
book of Genesis, about Isaac going out "to meditate in the field
at eventide." After we had sauntered about the place a few
minutes&mdash;during which the old cottager watched us with a calm
but curious eye&mdash;we went toward him with the usual salutation
about it being a "fine neet," and such like. He melted at once
from his statuesque curiosity, and, stepping slowly from the
threshold, with his arms folded, replied, "Ay, it is, for sure....
Wi'n had grand groo-weather<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> as week or two. But
a sawp o' deawnfo' 'ud do a seet o' good just neaw; an' we'st
ha' some afore lung; or aw'm chetted. Owd Knowe<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> has bin
awsin to put hur durty cap on a time or two to-day; an' as soon
as hoo can shap to tee it, there'll be wayter amoon us, yo'n see."
His dame, hearing the conversation, came forth to see what was
going on, and wandered slowly after us down the lane. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
was a strong-built and portly old woman, taller than her
husband; and her light-complexioned face beamed with health
and simplicity. The evening was mild and still, and the old
woman wore no bonnet; nor even the usual kerchief on her
head. Her cap and apron were white as new snow, and all her
attire looked sound and sweet, though of homely cut and quality.
I knew, somehow, that the clothes she wore were scented with
lavender or such like herbs, which country folk lay at the bottom
of the "kist," for the sake of the aroma which they impart
to their clothing. And no king's linen could be more wholesomely
perfumed. Give me a well-washed shirt, bleached on a
country hedge, and scented with country herbs! The hues
of sunset glowed above the lofty moors in front of us, and
the stir of day was declining into the rich hum of summer
evening. The atmosphere immediately around seemed clearer
than when the sun was up; but a shade of hazy gray was
creeping over the far east. We lounged along the lane, with
the comely dame following us silently, at a distance of three
or four yards, wondering what we could be, and why we had
wandered into that nook at such a time. After a little talk
with the old man, about the hay-crop, the news of the town,
and such like, we asked him whether the spot we were upon was
Grislehurst; and he replied, "Yo're upo' the very clod."</p>

<p>We then inquired where Grislehurst Hall stood; and whether
the building of which his cottage was a part, had been any
way connected with it.</p>

<p>He brightened up at the mention of Grislehurst Hall; and,
turning sharply round, he said with an air of surprise, "What!
dun yo pretend to know aught abeawt Gerzlehus' Ho'?...
Not mich, aw think; bi'th look on yo."</p>

<p>I told him that all we knew of it was from reading, and from
what we had heard about it; and that, happening to be in the
neighbourhood, we had wandered up to see if there were any
remains of it in existence.</p>

<p>"Ay, well," said he&mdash;and as he said it, his tone and manner
assumed a touch of greater importance than before&mdash;"if that's
o' th' arran' yo han, aw deawt yo'n made a lost gate. Noather
yo, nor nobory elze needs to look for Gerzlehus' Ho' no more.
It's gwon, lung sin!... But yo'n let reet for yerrin a bit
o' summat abeawt it, if that'll do." He then turned slowly
round, and, pointing to a plot of meadow land which abutted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
upon a dingle, to the south, he said, "Yo see'n that piece o'
meadow lond, at th' edge o'th green hollow theer?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well; that's the spot wheer Gerzlehus' Ho' stoode, when
aw're a lad. To look at't neaw, yo wouldn't think at oathur
heawse or hut had studd'n upo' that clod; for it's as good a bit
o' meadow lond as ever scythe swept.... But that's
the very spot wheer Gerzlehus' Ho' stoode. An' it're a fine
place too, mind yo; once't of a day. There's nought like it
upo' this country-side neaw; as heaw 'tis: noather Baemforth

potter't abeawt th' owd place, whol it doesn't look like th' same;
it doesn't for sure&mdash;not like th' same."</p>

<p>We now asked him again whether the large stone building, in
part of which he lived, had belonged to the old hall.</p>

<p>"Ay, well," said he, looking towards it, "that's noan sich a
feaw buildin', that isn't. That're part o'th eawt-heawsin to
Gerzlehus' Ho'; yo may see. There's a window theer, an' a dur-hole,
an' some moor odd bits abeawt it, of an owdish mak. Yo
con happen tay summat fro thoose. But it's divided into different
livin's neaw, yo see'n. There's a new farmer lives i'th top end
theer. He's made greyt awterations. It's a greadly good heawse
i'th inside; if yo see'd through."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "and what sort of a place was Grislehurst
Hall itself?"</p>

<p>"What, Gerzlehus' Ho'?" replied he; "well, aw should
know, as hea 'tis; if onybody does. Aw've been a good while
upo' th' clod for nought if I dunnut.... Ay, thae may
laugh; but aw're weel acquainted with this greawn afore thir
born, my lad&mdash;yers to mo, neaw?"<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>
<p>I made some excuse for having smiled, and he went on.</p>

<p>"Gerzlehus' Ho' wur a very greyt place, yo may depend.
It're mostly built o' heavy oak bauks.... There wur ir
Jammy lad,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> an' me, an' some moor on us&mdash;eh, we han carted
some of a lot o' loads o' fine timber an' stuff off that spot, at
time an' time! An' there's bin a deeol o' good flags, an' sich
like, ta'en eawt o'th lond wheer th' heawse stoode; an' eawt
o'th hollow below theer&mdash;there has so."</p>

<p>"How long is that since?" said I.</p>

<p>The old woman, who had been listening behind us, with her
hands clasped under her apron, now stepped up, and said,</p>

<p>"Heaw lung sin? Why, it's aboon fifty year sin. He should
know moor nor yo abeawt it, aw guess."</p>

<p>"Ay," said the old man, "aw've known this clod aboon fifty
year, for sure. An' see yo," continued he, "there wur a shootin'-butts
i' that hollow; sin aw can tell on. And upo' yon green,"
said he, turning round towards the north, and pointing off at the
end of the building, "upo' yon green there stoode an owd sun-dial,
i'th middle of a piece o' lond at's bin a chapel-yort, aforetime.
They say'n there's graves theer yet. An' upo' that knowe,
wheer th' new barn stons, there wur a place o' worship&mdash;so th'
tale gwos."</p>

<p>It was clear that we had set him going on a favourite theme,
and we must, therefore, bide the issue.</p>

<p>Turning his face to the west, he pointed towards a green eminence
at a short distance, and said, "To this day they co'n yon
hillock 'Th' Castle,' upo' keawnt on there once being a place
theer where prisoners were confin't. An' that hee greawnd gwos
bi'th name o'th 'Gallows Hill;' what for, I know not."</p>

<p>He then paused, and, pointing to a little hollow near the place
where we stood, he slightly lowered his voice as he continued&mdash;"An'
then, aw reckon yo see'n yon bend i'th lone, wheer th'
ash tree stons?"</p>

<p>"Ay."</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "that's the very spot wheer Gerzlehus'
Boggart's buried."</p>

<p>My thoughts had so drifted away in another direction, that I
was not prepared for such an announcement as this. I was
aware that the inhabitants of that district clung to many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
superstitions of their forefathers; but the thing came upon me
so unexpectedly, and when my mind was so quietly absorbed in
dreams of another sort, that, if the old man had fired off a pistol
close to my ear, I should not have been much more astonished;
though I might have been more startled. All that I had been
thinking of vanished at once; and my curiosity was centred in
this new phase of the old man's story. I looked into his face to
see whether he really meant what he had said; but there it was,
sure enough. In every outward feature he endorsed the sincerity
of his inward feeling. His countenance was as solemn as an
unlettered gravestone.</p>

<p>"Grislehurst Boggart;" said I, looking towards the place
once more.</p>

<p>"Ay;" replied he. "That's wheer it wur laid low; an' some
of a job it wur. Yo happen never yerd on't afore."</p>

<p>The old woman now took up the story, with more earnestness
even than her husband.</p>

<p>"It's a good while sin it wur laid; an' there wur a cock
buried wi' it, with a stoop<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> driven through it. It're noan sattle't
with a little; aw'll uphowd yo."</p>

<p>"And dun you really think, then," said I, "that this place has
been haunted by a boggart?"</p>

<p>"Has bin&mdash;be far!" replied she. "It is neaw! Yodd'n soon
find it eawt, too, iv yo live't upo' th' spot. It's very mich if it
wouldn't may yor yure ston of an end; oathur wi' one marlock
or another.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> There's noan so mony folk at likes to go deawn
yon lone, at after delit,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> aw con tell yo."</p>

<p>"But, if it's laid and buried," replied I, "it surely doesn't
trouble you now."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said the old woman, "iv it doesn't, it doesn't; so
there needs no moor. Aw know some folk winnot believe sich
things; there is at'll believe nought at o', iv it isn't fair druvven
into 'em, wilto, shalto;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> but this is a different case, mind yo.
Eh, never name it; thoose at has it to deeol wi' knows what it
is; but thoose at knows nought abeawt sich like&mdash;whau, it's like
summat an' nought talkin' to 'em abeawt it: so we'n e'en lap it
up where it is."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well, well, but stop," said the old man. "Yo say'n 'at it
doesn't trouble us neaw. Why, it isn't aboon a fortnit sin
th' farmer's wife at the end theer yerd summat i'th deeod
time o'th neet; an' hoo wur welly thrut eawt o' bed, too,
beside&mdash;so then."</p>

<p>"Ah," said the old woman, "sich wark as that's scarrin',<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
i'th neet time.... An' they never could'n find it eawt.
But aw know'd what it wur in a minute. Th' farmer's wife
an me wur talking it o'er again, yesterday; an' hoo says 'at
ever sin it happen't hoo gets quite timmersome as soon as it
drays toawrd th' edge o' dark; iv there's nobory i'th heawse
but hersel'.... Well, an' one wyndy neet&mdash;as aw're
sittin' bi'th fire&mdash;aw yerd summat like a&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the old man interrupted her:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's no use folk tellin' me at they dunnut believe sich like
things," said he, seeming not to notice his wife's story; "it's
no use tellin' me they dunnut believe it! Th' pranks at it's
played abeawt this plaze, at time an' time, would flay ony wick
soul to yer tell on."</p>

<p>"Never name it!" said she; "aw know whether they would'n
or not.... One neet, as aw're sittin by mysel'&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her husband interposed again, with an abstracted air:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Un-yaukin' th' horses; an' turnin' carts an' things o'er i'th
deep neet time; an' shiftin' stuff up and deawn, when folk
are i' bed; it's rather flaysome, yo may depend. But then,
aw know, there isn't a smite o' sense i' flingin' one's wynt away
wi' telling o' sich things, to some folk.... It's war nor
muckin' wi' sond, an' drainin' wi' cinders."</p>

<p>"And it's buried yonder," said I.</p>

<p>"Ay," replied he, "just i'th hollow; where th' ash tree is.
That used to be th' owd road to Rachda', when aw're a lad."</p>

<p>"Do you never think of delving the ground up," said I.</p>

<p>"Delve! nawe," answered he; "aw'st delve noan theer."</p>

<p>The old woman broke in again:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nawe; he'll delve noan theer; nut iv aw know it! Nor
no mon else dar lay a finger upo' that clod. Joseph Fenton's<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
a meeterly bowd chap; an' he's ruvven everything up abeawt
this country-side, welly; but he dar not touch Gerzlehus' Boggart,
for his skin! An' aw houd his wit good, too, mind yo!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>
<p>It was useless attempting to unsettle the superstitions of this
primitive pair. They were too far gone. And it was, perhaps,
best to let the old couple glide on through the evening of their
life, untroubled by any ill-timed wrangling.</p>

<p>But the old dame suspected, by our looks, that we were on
easy terms with our opinion of the tale; and she said, "Aw
dunnot think yo believ'n a wort abeawt it!"</p>

<p>This made us laugh in a way that left little doubt upon the
question; and she turned away from us, saying, "Well, yo're
weel off iv yo'n nought o' that mak o' yo'r country-side."</p>

<p>We had now got into the fields, in the direction by which we
intended to make our way home; and the old people seemed
inclined to return to their cottage. We halted, and looked round
a few minutes, before parting.</p>

<p>"You've lived here a good while," said I to the old man,
"and know all the country round."</p>

<p>"Aw know every fuut o'th greawnd about this part&mdash;hill an'
hollow, wood and wayter-stid."</p>

<p>"You are getting to a good age, too," continued I.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "aw'm gettin' boudly on into th' fourth
score. Ir breed are a lungish-wynded lot, yo see'n; tak 'em
one wi' another."</p>

<p>"You appear to have good health, for your age," said I.</p>

<p>"Well," replied he, "aw ail mich o' nought yet&mdash;why,

<p>"It's gettin' time to rest at your age, too."</p>

<p>"Whau; wark's no trouble to me, as lung as aw con do't.

<p>"Isn't Grislehurst cold and lonely in winter time?"</p>

<p>"Well; it is&mdash;rayther," said he. "But we dunnot think as
mich at it as teawn's-folk would do.... It'll be a greyt
deeol warse at th' top o' Know hill yon, see yo. It's cowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
enough theer to starve an otter to deeoth, i' winter time. But,
here, we're reet enough, for th' matter o' that. An' as for company,
we gwon a-neighbourin' a bit, neaw an' then, yo see'n. Beside,
we getten to bed sooner ov a neet nor they dun in a teawn."</p>

<p>"To my thinkin'," said the old woman, "aw wouldn't live in
a teawn iv eh mut wear red shoon."</p>

<p>"But you hav'n't many neighbours about here."</p>

<p>"Oh, yigh," said he. "There's th' farmer's theer; and one
or two moor. An' then, there's th' 'Top o'th Wood' folk.
Then there's 'Hooley Clough,' and th' 'War Office,'<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>&mdash;we can

An' wheer dun yo come fro, sen yo?"</p>

<p>We told him.</p>

<p>"Well," said he; "an' are yo i'th buildin' line&mdash;at aw mun
be so bowd?"</p>

<p>We again explained the motive of our visit.</p>

<p>"Well," said he; "it's nought to me, at aw know on&mdash;nobbut
aw're thinkin' like.... Did'n yo ever see Baemforth Ho',
afore it're poo'd deawn?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Eh, that're a nice owd buildin'! Th' new un hardly comes
up to't, i' my e'en&mdash;as fine as it is.... An' are yo beawn
back this gate, then?"</p>

<p>"Ay; we want to go through th' clough."</p>

<p>"Well; yo mun mind heaw yo gwon deawn th' wood-side;
for it's a rough gate. So, good neet to yo!"</p>

<p>We bade them both "Good night!" and were walking away,
when he shouted back, "Hey! aw say! Dun yo know Ned o'
Andrew's?" "No." "He's the very mon for yo! Aw've
just unbethought mo! He knows moor cracks nor onybody
o' this side&mdash;an' he'll sit a fire eawt ony time, tellin' his bits o'
tales. Sper ov anybody at Hooley Bridge, an' they'n tell yo
wheer he lives. So, good neet to yo!"</p>

<p>Leaving the two old cottagers, and their boggart-haunted hamlet,
we went over the fields towards Simpson Clough. The steep
sides of this romantic spot are mostly clothed with woods of oak
and birch. For nearly a mile's length, the clough is divided into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
two ravines, deep, narrow, and often craggy&mdash;and shady with
trees. Two streams flow down from the moors above, each
through one of these gloomy defiles, till they unite at a place from
whence the clough continues its way southward, in one wider and
less shrouded expanse, but still between steep and rocky banks,
partly wooded. When the rains are heavy upon the moors,
these streams rush furiously through their rock-bound courses
in the narrow ravines, incapable of mischief, till they meet at
the point where the clough becomes one, when they thence
form a strong and impetuous torrent, which has, sometimes,
proved destructive to property lower down the valley. Coming
to the western brink of this clough, we skirted along in search
of an opening by which we could go down into it with the least
difficulty. A little removed from the eastern edge, and nearly
opposite to us, stood Bamford new hall, the residence of James
Fenton, Esq., one of the wealthy cotton-spinners in this locality.
A few yards from that mansion, and nearer to the edge of the
clough, stood, a few years ago, the venerable hall of the Bamfords
of Bamford, one of the oldest families belonging to the old local
gentry; and, probably, among the first Saxon settlers there.
Thomas de Bamford occurs about 1193. Adam de Bamford
granted land in villa de Bury, to William de Chadwick, in 1413;
and Sir John Bamford was a fellow of the Collegiate Church of
Manchester, in 1506.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> A William Bamford, Esq., of Bamford,
served the office of High Sheriff of the county, in 1787. He
married Ann, daughter of Thomas Blackburne, Esq., of Orford
and Hale, and was father of Ann, lady of John Ireland Blackburne,
Esq., M.P. He was succeeded by Robert Bamford, Esq., who,
from his connection with the Heskeths of Cheshire, took the name
of Robert Bamford Hesketh, Esq., and married Miss Frances
Lloyd, of Gwrych Castle. Lloyd Hesketh Bamford Hesketh,
Esq., of Gwrych Castle, Denbighshire, married Emily Esther
Ann, youngest daughter of Earl Beauchamp.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The old hall of the
Bamfords was taken down a few years ago. I do not remember
ever seeing it myself, but the following particulars respecting it
have been kindly furnished to me by a native gentleman, who
knew it well:&mdash;"It was a fine old building of the Tudor style,
with three gables in front, which looked towards the high road;
it was of light-coloured ashler stone, such as is found in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
neighbourhood; with mullions, and quaint windows and doors
to match; and was, I think, dated about 1521. Such another
building you will certainly not find on this side of the county.
Castleton Hall comes, in my opinion, nearest to it in venerable
appearance; but Bamford Hall had a lighter and more cheerful
aspect; its situation, also, almost on the edge of the rocky
chasm of Simpson Clough, or, as it is often called, Guestless, <i>i.e.</i>
Grislehurst Clough, gave an air of romance to the place, which
I do not remember to have noticed about any ancient residence
with which I am acquainted."</p>

<p>Stillness was falling upon the scene; but the evening wind
sung lulling vespers in Grislehurst wood; and, now and then,
there rose from the rustling green, the silvery solo of some
lingering singer in those leafy choirs, as we worked our way
through the shade of the wood, until we came to the bed of
"Nadin Water," in the shrouded hollow of the clough. The
season had been dry, and the water lay in quiet pools of the
channel,&mdash;gleaming in the gloom, where the light fell through
the trees. We made our way onward, sometimes leaping
from stone to stone in the bed of the stream, sometimes
tearing over the lower part of the bank, which was broken
and irregular, and scattered with moss-greened fragments of
fallen rock, or slippery and swampy with lodgments of damp,
fed by rindles and driblets of water, running more or less,
in all seasons, from springs in the wood-shaded steep. In
some parts, the bank was overgrown with scratchy thickets,
composed of dogberry-stalks, wild rose-bushes, prickly hollins
and thorns, young hazles and ash trees; broad-leaved docks,
and tall, drooping ferns; and, over all, hung the thick green of
the spreading wood. Pushing aside the branches, we laboured
on till we came into the opening where the streams combine.
A stone bridge crosses the water at this spot, leading
up to the woody ridge which separates the two ravines, in
the upper part of the clough. Here we climbed from
the bed of the stream, and got upon a cart-road which
led out of the clough, and up to the Rochdale road, which
crosses the lower end of it, at a considerable elevation. The
thin crescent of a new moon's rim hung like a silver sickle
in the sky; and the stars were beginning to glow, in "Jove's
eternal house!" whilst the fading world below seemed hushed
with awe, to see that sprinkling of golden lights coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
out in silence once more from the over-spanning blue. We
walked up the slope, from the silent hollow, between the
woods, and over the knoll, and down into Hooley Clough
again, by the way we came at first. Country people were
sauntering about, upon the main road, and in the bye-lanes,
thereabouts, in twos and threes. In the village of Hooley Bridge,
the inhabitants were lounging at their cottage doors, in neighbourly
talk, enjoying the close of a summer day; and, probably,
"Ned o' Andrew's" was sitting in some quiet corner of the
village, amusing a circle of eager listeners with his quaint
country tales.</p>

<p>A short walk brought us to the end of our ramble, and
we sat down to talk over what we had seen and heard. My
visit to Grislehurst had been all the more interesting that I
had no thought of meeting with such a living evidence of
the lingering superstitions of Lancashire there. I used to like
to sit with country folk, hearkening to their old-world tales of
boggarts, and goblins, and fairies,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That plat the manes of horses in the night,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And cake the elf lock in foul, sluttish airs;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>and I had thought myself well acquainted with the boggart-lore
of my native district; but the goblin of Grislehurst was new to
me. By this time I knew that in remote country houses the
song of the cricket and the ticking of the clock were beginning
to be distinctly heard; and that in many a solitary cottage these
were, now, almost the only sounds astir, except the cadences
of the night wind, sighing around, and making every crevice
into a voice of mystic import to superstitious listeners; while,
perhaps, the rustle of the trees blended with the dreamy ripple
of some neighbouring brooklet. The shades of night would, by
this time, have fallen upon the haunted homesteads of Grislehurst,
and, in the folds of that dusky robe, would have brought to the
old cottagers their usual fears, filled with</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Shaping fantasies, that apprehend</span><br />
<span class="i0">More than cool reason ever comprehends;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>and I could imagine the good old pair creeping off to repose,
and covering up their eyes more carefully than usual from the
goblin-peopled gloom, after the talk we had with them about
Grislehurst Boggart.</p>

<p class="drop-capi1"><span class="smcap">There</span> is a quiet little clough about three miles from
Manchester, near the old village of Blackley. The
best entrance to it is by a gateway leading from
the southern edge of a shady steep called "Entwisle
Broo," on the highway from Manchester to Middleton. Approaching
the spot in this direction, a winding road leads down
between a low bemossed wall on the right, and a thorn hedge,
which screens the green depth on the left. The trees which
line the path overlap the way with shade in summer time,
till it reaches the open hollow, where stands a brick-built
farm-house, with its outbuildings, and gardens,&mdash;sheltered in
the rear by the wooded bank of the clough. Thence, this
pretty Lancashire dell wanders on southward for a considerable
distance, in picturesque quietude. The township of Blackley,
in which it is situated, retains many traces of its former
rural beauty, and some remnants of the woods which once
covered the district. As a whole, Blackley is, even yet,
so pleasantly varied in natural feature as to rank among
the prettiest scenery around Manchester, although its valleys
are now, almost all of them, more or less, surrendered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
the conquering march of manufacture&mdash;all, except this secluded
glen, known by the name of "Boggart Ho' Clough."
Here, still, in this sylvan "deer-leap" of the Saxon hunter,
the lover of nature, and the jaded townsman, have a tranquil
sanctuary, where they can wander, cloistered from the tumults
of life; and there is many a contemplative rambler who
seeks the retirement of this leafy dell, the whole aspect of
which seems to invite the mind to a "sessions of sweet,
silent thought." One can imagine it such a place as a man
of poetic temperament would delight in; and the interest
which has gathered around it is not lessened by the fact,
that before Samuel Bamford, the poet, left this district to
take up his abode in the metropolis, he dwelt at a pleasant
cottage, on the summit of the upland, near the eastern
edge of the clough. And here, in his native sequestration,
he may have sometimes felt the significance of Burns's
words,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The muse, nae poet ever fand her,</span><br />

<span class="i12">And no think lang.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>The rural charms and retired peacefulness of "Boggart Ho'
Clough" might well, in the vicinity of a place like Manchester,
account for part of its local celebrity; but not for
the whole of it. The superstitions of the locality and the
shaping power of imagination have clothed the place with
an interest which does not solely belong to the embowered
gloom of its green recesses; nor to its picturesque steeps,
overgrown with fern and underwood; nor to the beauty of
its swardy holm, spreading out a pleasant space in the vale;
nor to the wimpling rill which wanders through it from
end to end,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Amongst the pumy stones, which seem to plaine,</span><br />
<span class="i0">With gentle murmure, that his course they do restraine.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>Man has clothed the scene in a drapery of wonder and fear,
woven in the creative loom of his own imagination. Any
superstitious stranger, wandering there, alone, under the influence
of a midnight moon, would probably think this a likely place for
the resort of those spiritual beings who "fly by night." He
might truly say, at such an hour, that if ever "Mab" held
court on the green earth, "Boggart Ho' Clough" is just such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
a nook, as one can imagine, that her mystic choir would delight
to dance in, and sing,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Come, follow, follow me,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Ye fairy elves that be,</span><br />

<span class="i0">Hand in hand we'll dance around,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For this place is fairy ground.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>The place is now associated with the superstitions of the district;
and on that account, as well as on account of its natural attractions,
it has been the theme of more than one notable pen. In Roby's
"Traditions of Lancashire," there is a story called "The Bar-gaist,
or Boggart," which is connected with "Boggart Ho'
Clough." From this story, which was contributed to that work
by Mr. Crofton Croker, author of "The Fairy Legends," I
quote the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not far from the little snug, smoky village of Blakeley, or
Blackley, there lies one of the most romantic of dells, rejoicing
in a state of singular seclusion, and in the oddest of Lancashire
names, to wit, 'Boggart-Hole.' Rich in every requisite for picturesque
beauty and poetical association, it is impossible for me
(who am neither a painter nor a poet) to describe this dell as it
should be described; and I will, therefore, only beg of thee,
gentle reader, who, peradventure, mayst not have lingered in
this classical neighbourhood, to fancy a deep, deep dell, its steep
sides fringed down with hazel and beech, and fern and thick
undergrowth, and clothed at the bottom with the richest and
greenest sward in the world. You descend, clinging to the trees,
and scrambling as best you may,&mdash;and now you stand on haunted
ground! Tread softly, for this is the Boggart's clough. And
see in yonder dark corner, and beneath the projecting mossy
stone, where that dusky, sullen cave yawns before us, like a bit
of Salvator's best: there lurks that strange elf, the sly and mischievous
Boggart. Bounce! I see him coming;&mdash;oh no, it was
only a hare bounding from her form; there it goes&mdash;there!</p>

<p>"I will tell you of some of the pranks of this very Boggart,
and how he teased and tormented a good farmer's family in a
house hard by; and I assure you it was a very worthy old lady
who told me the story. But, first, suppose we leave the Boggart's
demesne, and pay a visit to the theatre of his strange doings.</p>

<p>"You see that old farm-house about two fields distant, shaded
by the sycamore tree: that was the spot which the Boggart or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Bar-gaist selected for his freaks; there he held his revels, perplexing
honest George Cheetham&mdash;for that was the farmer's
name&mdash;scaring his maids, worrying his men, and frightening the
poor children out of their seven senses; so that, at last, not even
a mouse durst show himself indoors at the farm, as he valued his
whiskers, five minutes after the clock had struck twelve."</p>

<p>The story goes on describing the startling pranks of this invisible
torment of honest George Cheetham's old haunted dwelling.
It tells how that the Boggart, which was a long time a terror to
the farmer's family, "scaring the maids, worrying the men, and
frightening the poor children," became at last a familiar, mysterious
presence&mdash;in a certain sense, a recognised member of the
household troop&mdash;often heard, but never seen; and sometimes a
sharer in the household conversation. When merry tales were
being told around the fire, on winter nights, the Boggart's "small,
shrill voice, heard above the rest, like a baby's penny trumpet,"
joined the general laughter, in a tone of supernatural congeniality;
and the hearers learned, at last, to hear without dismay, if not to
love the sounds which they had feared before. But Boggarts,
like men, are moody creatures; and this unembodied troubler of
the farmer's lonely house seems to have been sometimes so forgetful
of everything like spiritual dignity, or even of the claims
of old acquaintance, as to reply to the familiar banter of his
mortal co-tenants, in a tone of petty malignity. He even went
so far, at last, as to revenge himself for some fancied insult, by
industriously pulling the children up and down by the head and
legs in the night time, and by screeching and laughing plaguily in
the dark, to the unspeakable annoyance of the inmates. In order
to get rid of this nocturnal torment, it appears that the farmer
removed his children into other sleeping apartments, leaving the
Boggart sole tenant of their old bedroom, which seems to have been
his favourite stage of action. The story concludes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But his Boggartship, having now fairly become the possessor
of a room at the farm, it would appear, considered himself in the
light of a privileged inmate, and not, as hitherto, an occasional
visitor, who merely joined in the general expression of merriment.
Familiarity, they say, breeds contempt; and now the children's
bread and butter would be snatched away, or their porringers of
bread and milk would be dashed to the ground by an unseen
hand; or, if the younger ones were left alone but for a few
minutes, they were sure to be found screaming with terror on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
the return of their nurse. Sometimes, however, he would behave
himself kindly. The cream was then churned, and the pans and
kettles scoured without hands. There was one circumstance
which was remarkable:&mdash;the stairs ascended from the kitchen;
a partition of boards covered the ends of the steps, and formed
a closet beneath the staircase. From one of the boards of this
partition a large round knot was accidentally displaced; and one
day the youngest of the children, while playing with the shoehorn,
stuck it into this knot-hole. Whether or not the aperture
had been formed by the Boggart as a peep-hole to watch the
motions of the family, I cannot pretend to say. Some thought
it was, for it was called the Boggart's peep-hole; but others said
that they had remembered it long before the shrill laugh of the
Boggart was heard in the house. However this may have been,
it is certain that the horn was ejected with surprising precision
at the head of whoever put it there; and either in mirth or in
anger the horn was darted forth with great velocity, and struck
the poor child over the ear.</p>

<p>"There are few matters upon which parents feel more acutely
than that of the maltreatment of their offspring; but time, that
great soother of all things, at length familiarised this dangerous
occurrence to every one at the farm, and that which at the first
was regarded with the utmost terror, became a kind of amusement
with the more thoughtless and daring of the family. Often was
the horn slipped slyly into the hole, and in return it never failed
to be flung at the head of some one, but most commonly at the
person who placed it there. They were used to call this pastime,
in the provincial dialect, 'laking wi't' Boggart;' that is playing
with the Boggart. An old tailor, whom I but faintly remember,
used to say that the horn was often 'pitched' at his head, and at
the head of his apprentice, whilst seated here on the kitchen
table, when they went their rounds to work, as is customary
with country tailors. At length the goblin, not contented with
flinging the horn, returned to his night persecutions. Heavy
steps, as of a person in wooden clogs, were at first heard clattering
down stairs in the dead hour of darkness; then the pewter and
earthen dishes appeared to be dashed on the kitchen floor; though
in the morning all remained uninjured on their respective shelves.
The children generally were marked out as objects of dislike by
their unearthly tormentor. The curtains of their beds would be
violently pulled to and fro; then a heavy weight, as of a human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
being, would press them nigh to suffocation, from which it was
impossible to escape. The night, instead of being the time for
repose, was disturbed with screams and dreadful noises, and thus
was the whole house alarmed night after night. Things could
not long continue in this fashion; the farmer and his good dame
resolved to leave a place where they could no longer expect rest
or comfort; and George Cheetham was actually following, with
his wife and family, the last load of furniture, when they were
met by a neighbouring farmer, named John Marshall.</p>

<p>"'Well, Georgy, and so yo're leaving th' owd house at last?'
said Marshall.</p>

<p>"'Heigh, Johnny, my lad, I'm in a manner forced to't, thou
sees,' replied the other; 'for that weary Boggart torments us so,
we can neither rest neet nor day for't. It seems like to have a
malice again't young uns, an' ommost kills my poor dame here
at thoughts on't, and so thou sees we're forc'd to flit like.'</p>

<p>"He had got thus far in his complaint, when, behold, a shrill
voice, from a deep upright churn, the topmost utensil on the
cart, called out, 'Ay, ay, neighbour, we're flitting, yo see.'</p>

<p>"'Od rot thee,' exclaimed George: 'if I'd known thou'd
been flitting too, I wadn't ha' stirred a peg. Nay, nay, it's to
no use, Mally,' he continued, turning to his wife, 'we may as
weel turn back again to th' owd house, as be tormented in
another not so convenient.'"</p>

<p>Thus endeth Crofton Croker's tradition of the "Boggart," or
"Bar-gaist," which, according to the story, was long time a
well-known supernatural pest of old Cheetham's farm-house, but
whose principal lurking place was supposed to be in a gloomy
nook of "Boggart Ho' Clough," or "Boggart Hole Clough," for
the name adopted by the writer of the tradition appears to be
derived from that superstitious belief. With respect to the exact
origin of the name, however, I must entirely defer to those who
know more about the matter than myself. The features of the
story are, generically, the same as those of a thousand such like
superstitious stories still told and believed in all the country parts
of England&mdash;though perhaps more in the northern part of it
than elsewhere. Almost every lad in Lancashire has, in his
childhood, heard, either from his "reverend grannie," or from
some less kin and less kind director of his young imagination,
similar tales connected with old houses, and other haunts, in the
neighbourhood of his own birthplace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>Among those who have noticed "Boggart Ho' Clough," is
Mr. Samuel Bamford, well known as a poet, and a graphic prose
writer upon the stormy political events of his earlier life, and
upon whatever relates to the manners and customs of Lancashire.
In describing matters of the latter kind, he has the advantage of
being "native and to the manner born;" and still more specially
so in everything connected with the social peculiarities of
the locality of his birth. He was born at Middleton, about
two miles from "Boggart Ho' Clough," and, as I said before,
he resided for some years close to the clough itself. In his
"Passages in the Life of a Radical," vol. 1. p. 130, there begins
one of the raciest descriptions of Lancashire characteristics
with which I am acquainted. The first part of this passage
contains a descriptive account of "Plant," a country botanist;
"Chirrup," a bird-catcher; and "Bangle," a youth "of an ardent
temperament, but bashful," who was deeply in love with "a
young beauty residing in the house of her father, who held a
small milk-farm on the hill-side, not far from Old Birkle." It
describes the meeting of the three in the lone cottage of Bangle's
mother, near Grislehurst wood; the conversation that took place
there; and the superstitious adventure they agreed upon, in order
to deliver young Bangle from the hopelessness of his irresistible
and unrequited love-thrall. "His modest approaches had not
been noticed by the adored one; and, as she had danced with
another youth at Bury fair, he imagined she was irrecoverably
lost to him, and the persuasion had almost driven him melancholy.
Doctors had been applied to, but he was no better; philters and
charms had been tried to bring down the cold-hearted maid&mdash;but
all in vain:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"He sought her at the dawn of day;</span><br />
<span class="i2">He sought her at the noonin';</span><br />
<span class="i2">He sought her when the evening gray</span><br />
<span class="i2">Had brought the hollow moon in.</span><br />
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"He call'd her on the darkest night,</span><br />
<span class="i2">With wizard spells to bind her:</span><br />
<span class="i2">And when the stars arose in light,</span><br />
<span class="i2">He wandered forth to find her.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>"At length sorcerers and fortune-tellers were thought of, and
'Limping Billy,' a noted seer, residing at Radcliffe Bridge, having
been consulted, said the lad had no chance of gaining power over
the damsel, unless he could take Saint John's Fern seed; and if
he could but secure three grains of that, he might bring to him
whatever he wished, that walked, flew, or swam."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>Such being the conditions laid down, and believed in by the
three, they resolved to venture, together, on the taking of Saint
John's Fern seed, with strict observance of the time and the
cabalistic ceremonials enjoined by "Limping Billy," the seer, of
Radcliffe Bridge. "Plant," the botanist, "knew where the finest
clump of fern in the country grew;" and he undertook to accompany
"Chirrup" and "Bangle" to the spot, at the time
appointed, the eve of St. John the Baptist. The remainder of
the passage describes "Boggart Ho' Clough," the spot in which
St. John's Fern then grew in great abundance, and where the
botanists of the district still find the plant; it describes, also, the
fearful enterprise of the three at the witching hour of midnight,
in search of the enchanted seed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On the left hand, reader, as thou goest towards Manchester,
ascending from Blackley, is a rather deep valley, green swarded,
and embowered in plantations and older woods. A driving path,
which thou enterest by a white gate hung on whale-jaw posts,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
leads down to a grove of young trees, by a modern and substantial
farm-house, with green shutters, sashed windows, and flowers
peeping from the sills. A mantle of ivy climbs the wall, a garden
is in front, and an orchard, redolent of bloom, and fruit in
season, nods on the hill-top above. Here, at the time Plant was
speaking of, stood a very ancient house, built partly of old-fashioned
bricks, and partly of a timber frame, filled with raddlings and
daub (wicker-work plastered with clay). It was a lone and
desolate-looking house indeed; misty and fearful, even at noonday.
It was known as 'Boggart-ho',' or 'Fyrin'-ho';' and the
gorge in which it is situated, was, and is still, known as 'Boggart'
or 'Fyrin-ho' Kloof,' 'the glen of the hall of spirits.' Such a
place, might we suppose, had Milton in contemplation, when he
wrote the passage of his inimitable poem:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Tells how the drudging goblin sweat,</span><br />
<span class="i2">To earn his cream-bowl, duly set,</span><br />
<span class="i2">When, in one night, ere glimpse of morn,</span><br />
<span class="i2">His shadowy flail had thrash'd the corn</span><br />
<span class="i2">Which ten day-labourers could not end;</span><br />
<span class="i2">Then lies him down, the lubber fiend:</span><br />
<span class="i2">And, stretch'd out all the chimney's length,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Basks at the fire, his hairy strength;</span><br />
<span class="i2">And cropful, out of door he flings,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Ere the first cock his matin sings.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>
<p>"By the side of the house, and through the whole length of
the valley, wends a sickly, tan-coloured rindle, which, issuing
from the great White Moss, comes down, tinged with the colour
of its parent swamp. Opposite the modern house, a forbidden
road cuts through the plantation on the right towards Moston
Lane. Another path leads behind the house, up precipitous
banks, and through close bowers, to Booth Hall; and a third,
the main one, proceeds along the kloof, by the side of the stream,
and under sun-screening woods, until it forks into two roads:
one a cattle-track, to 'The Bell,' in Moston; and the other a
winding and precipitous footpath, to a farm-house at 'Wood-end,'
where it gains the broad upland, and emerges into unshaded day.</p>

<p>"About half way up this kloof, is an open, cleared space of
green and short sward: it is probably two hundred yards in
length, by sixty in width; and passing along it from Blackley,
a group of fine oaks appear, on a slight eminence, a little to the
left. This part of the grove was, at the time we are concerned
with, much more crowded with underwood than at present.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
The bushes were then close and strong; fine sprouts of 'yerth-groon'
hazel and ash were common as nuts; whilst a thick bush
of bramble, wild rose, and holly, gave the spot the appearance
of a place inclosed and set apart for mysterious concealment.
Intermingled with these almost impervious barriers, where tufts
of tall green fern, curling and bending gracefully; and a little
separate from them and near the old oaks, might be observed a
few fern clumps of a singular appearance; of a paler green than
the others&mdash;with a flatter and a broader leaf&mdash;sticking up, rigid
and expanded, like something stark with mute terror. These
were 'Saint John's Fern;' and the finest of them was the one
selected by Plant for the experiment now to be described.</p>

<p>"A little before midnight, on the eve of St. John, Plant,
Chirrup, and Bangle, where at the whale-jaw gate before-mentioned;
and, having slightly scanned each other, they proceeded,
without speaking, until they had crossed the brook at a
stepping-place, opposite the old Fyrin-ho'. The first word
spoken was&mdash;'What hast thou?'</p>


<p class="center">"'Mine is breawn an' roof,'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>said Plant, exhibiting a brown earthern dish. 'What hast thou?'
he then asked.</p>

<p class="center">"'Mine is breet enough,'</p>

<p>said Chirrup, showing a pewter platter, and continued, 'What
hast thou?'</p>

<p class="center">"'Teed wi' web an' woof,<br />
Mine is deep enough,'</p>

<p>said Bangle, displaying a musty, dun skull, with the cap sawn off
above the eyes, and left flapping like a lid by a piece of tanned
scalp, which still adhered. The interior cavities had also been
stuffed with moss and lined with clay, kneaded with blood from
human veins, and the youth had secured the skull to his shoulders
by a twine of three strands of unbleached flax, of undyed wool,
and of woman's hair, from which also depended a raven black
tress, which a wily crone had procured from the maid he sought
to obtain.</p>

<p class="center">"'That will do,'</p>

<p>said a voice, in a half whisper, from one of the low bushes they
were passing. Plant and Chirrup paused; but Bangle, who had
evidently his heart on the accomplishment of the undertaking,
said, 'Forward!&mdash;if we turn, now a spirit has spoken, we are
lost. Come on!' and they went forward.</p>

<p>"A silence, like that of death, was around them as they entered
on the opening platting. Nothing moved either in tree or brake.
Through a space in the foliage, the stars were seen pale in heaven,
and a crooked moon hung in a bit of blue amid motionless clouds.
All was still and breathless, as if earth, heaven, and the elements,
were aghast. Anything would have been preferable to that unnatural
stillness and silence&mdash;the hoot of the night owl, the larum
of the pit sparrow, the moan of the wind, the toll of a death-bell,
or the howl of a ban-dog, would, inasmuch as they are things of
this world, have been welcome sounds amid that horrid pause.
But no sound came and no object moved.</p>

<p>"Gasping, and with cold sweat oozing on his brow, Plant
recollected that they were to shake the fern with a forked rod
of witch hazel, and by no means must touch it with their hands,
and he asked, in a whisper, if the others had brought one. Both
said they had forgotten, and Chirrup said they had better never
have come; but Plant drew his knife, and stepping into a moonlighted
bush, soon returned with what was wanted, and they
went forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>"The green knowe, the old oaks, the encircled space, and
the fern, were now approached; the latter stiff and erect in
a gleamy light.</p>

<p>"'Is it deep neet?' said Bangle.</p>

<p>"'It is,' said Plant.</p>

<p class="center">The star that bids the shepherd fold,<br />
Now the top of heaven doth hold.</p>

<p>"And they drew near. All was still and motionless.</p>

<p>"Plant knelt on one knee, and held his dish under the fern.</p>

<p>"Chirrup held his broad plate next below, and</p>

<p>"Bangle knelt, and rested the skull directly under both on the
green sod; the lid being up.</p>

<p>"Plant said,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">'Good St John, this seed we crave,<br />
We have dared; shall we have?'</p>

<p>"A voice responded:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetrycenter">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">'Now the moon is downward starting,</div>
<div class="verse">Moon and stars are all departing;</div>
<div class="verse-indent">Quick, quick; shake, shake;</div>
<div class="verse">He whose heart shall soonest break,</div>
<div class="verse-indent">Let him take.'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>"They looked, and perceived by a glance that a venerable
form, in a loose robe, was near them.</p>

<p>"Darkness came down like a swoop. The fern was shaken, the
upper dish flew into pieces&mdash;the pewter one melted; the skull
emitted a cry, and eyes glared in its sockets; lights broke&mdash;beautiful
children were seen walking in their holiday clothes,
and graceful female forms sung mournful and enchanting airs.</p>

<p>"The men stood terrified, and fascinated; and Bangle, gazing,
bade, 'God bless 'em.' A crash followed as if the whole of the
timber in the kloof was being splintered and torn up; strange
and horrid forms appeared from the thickets; the men ran as if
sped on the wind&mdash;they separated, and lost each other. Plant
ran towards the old house, and there, leaping the brook, he cast
a glance behind him, and saw terrific shapes&mdash;some beastly,
some part human, and some hellish, gnashing their teeth, and
howling, and uttering the most fearful and mournful tones, as if
wishful to follow him but unable to do so.</p>

<p>"In an agony of terror he arrived at home, not knowing how
he got there. He was, during several days, in a state bordering
on unconsciousness; and, when he recovered, he learned that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Chirrup was found on the White Moss, raving mad, and chasing
the wild birds. As for poor Bangle, he found his way home over
hedge and ditch, running with supernatural and fearful speed&mdash;the
skull's eyes glaring at his back, and the nether jaw grinning
and jabbering frightful and unintelligible sounds. He had preserved
the seed, however, and, having taken it from the skull, he
buried the latter at the cross road from whence he had taken it.
He then carried the spell out, and his proud love stood one night
by his bed-side in tears. But he had done too much for human
nature&mdash;in three months after she followed his corpse, a real
mourner, to the grave!</p>

<p>"Such was the description my fellow-prisoner gave of what
occurred in the only trial he ever made with St John's Fern
seed. He was full of old and quaint narratives, and of superstitious
lore, and often would beguile time by recounting them.
Poor fellow! a mysterious fate hung over him also."</p>

<p>This description of "Boggart Ho' Clough," with its dramatic
embodiment of one of our strong local superstitions, is all
the more interesting from the pen of one who knew the
place and the people so well. I know no other writer who
is so able to portray the distinctive characteristics of the people
of South Lancashire as Samuel Bamford.</p>

<p>It is now some years since I visited the scene of the foregoing
traditions. At that time I was wholly unacquainted
with the last of these legends, and I knew little more about
"Boggart Ho' Clough," in any way, than its name indicates. I
sought the place, then, solely on account of its natural attractions.
Feeling curious, however, respecting the import of its name, and
dimly remembering Roby's tradition, I made some inquiry in the
neighbourhood, and found that, although some attributed the
name to the superstitious credulity of the native people, there
was one gentleman who nearly destroyed that theory in my
mind at the time, by saying that, a short time previous, he had
dined with a lawyer who informed him, in the course of a conversation
upon the same subject, that he had recently been at a
loss how to describe the place in question, having to prepare
some notices to be served on trespassers; and, on referring to the
title-deeds of the property, he found that a family of the name
of "Bowker" had formerly occupied a residence situated in the
clough, and that their dwelling was designated "Bowker's Hall."
This he adopted as the origin of the name, and described it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
accordingly. But the testimony of every writer who notices
the spot, especially those best acquainted with it, inclines to
the other derivation.</p>

<p>But the locality has other points of interest, besides this
romantic nook, and the tales of glamour connected with it.
In it there is many a boggart story, brought down from the
past, many a spot of fearful repute among native people.
Apart from all these things, the chapelry of Blackley is enriched
with historic associations well worth remembering, and it contains
some interesting relics of the ancient manner of life
there. In former times the chapelry had in it several fine old
halls: Booth Hall, Nuthurst Hall, Lightbowne Hall, Hough
Hall, Crumpsall Hall, and Blackley Hall. Some of these still
remain. Some of them have been the homes or the birthplaces
of men of eminence in their day&mdash;eminent for worth as well as
station&mdash;among whom there is more than one who has left a
long trail of honourable recollections behind him. Such men
were Humphrey Chetham, Bishop Oldham, and others. Bradford
the martyr, also, is said to have resided in this township.
William Chadderton, D.D., Bishop of Chester, and afterwards
Bishop of Lincoln, was born at Nuthurst Hall, about the year
1540. George Clarke, the founder of the charity which bears
his name, and one of Fuller's Worthies, resided in Crumpsall.
The following particulars respecting the district and its notabilities
I glean from the recently-published "History of the Ancient
Chapel of Blackley," by the Rev. John Booker, B.A., of Magdalene
College, Cambridge, curate of Prestwich. First, with respect to
the ancient state of Blackley, in the survey of Manchester, as taken
in the 15th Edward II. (1322), and preserved by Kuerden,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> the
following official notice of the township occurs:&mdash;"The park of
Blakeley is worth, in pannage, aëry of eagles, herons and hawks,
honey-bees, mineral earths, ashes, and other issues, fifty-three
shillings and fourpence. The vesture of oaks, with the whole
coverture, is worth two hundred marks [&pound;133. 6s. 8d.] in the
gross. It contains seven miles in circumference, together with
two deer-leaps, of the king's grant." This short but significant
passage is sufficient to give, the reader a glimpse of the appearance
of Blackley township five hundred years ago. From the
same authority, we learn that Blackley park (seven miles in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
circumference) was, at that time, surrounded and fenced in by a
wooden paling. "The two 'deer-leaps' were probably cloughs
or ravines, of which the most remarkable is the 'Boggart Hole
Clough,' a long cleft or dell between two rocks, the sides of
which rise abruptly and leave a narrow pass, widening a little
here and there, through which flows a small brook. This is the
last stronghold of Blackley's ancient characteristic features, where
rural tranquility still reigns, free from the bustle and turmoil of
mercantile industry around it."</p>

<p>The following particulars respecting the etymology of the name
"Blackley," will not be unacceptable to students of language:&mdash;"Its
etymology is yet a disputed point, owing to the various
significations of the Anglo-Saxon word, <i>blac</i>, <i>blæc</i>, <i>bleac</i>, which
means not only <i>black</i>, <i>dark</i>, <i>opaque</i>, and even <i>gloomy</i>, but also
<i>pale</i>, <i>faded</i>, <i>pallid</i>, from 'blæcan,' to bleach or make white.
And, as if these opposite meanings were not sufficiently perplexing,
two other forms present themselves, one of which means
<i>bleak</i>, <i>cold</i>, <i>bare</i>, and the other <i>yellow</i>; the latter syllable in the
name, <i>ley</i>, <i>legh</i>, <i>leag</i>, or <i>leah</i>, signifying a <i>field</i> or place of <i>pasture</i>."
On this point, Whittaker says, in his "History of Manchester,"
"The Saxon <i>blac</i>, <i>black</i>, or <i>blake</i>, frequently imports the deep
gloom of trees; hence we have so many places distinguished by
the epithet in England, where no circumstances of soil and no
peculiarities of water give occasion to it, as the villages of Blackburn
and Blackrode in Lancashire, Blakeley-hurst, near Wigan,
and our own Blackley, near Manchester; and the woods of the last
were even seven miles in circuit as late as the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>"Leland, who wrote about the year 1538, bears testimony to
the unaltered aspect of Blackley, under the influence of cultivation,
and to the changes incident to the disafforesting of its ancient
woodlands. He says:&mdash;'Wild bores, bulles, and falcons, bredde
in times past at Blakele, now for lack of woode the blow-shoppes
decay there.'<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>"Blackley had its resident minister as early as the reign of
Edward VI., in the person of Father Travis, a name handed
down to us in the pages of Fox and Strype. Travis was the
friend and correspondent of Bradford the martyr. In the succeeding
reign he suffered banishment for his Protestant principles,
and his place was probably supplied by a papist."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>
<p>The site upon which, in 1815, stood the old hall of Blackley,
is now occupied by a print-shop. Blackley Hall "was a spacious
black-and-white half-timbered mansion, in the post and petrel
style, and was situated near to the junction of the lane leading
to the chapel and the Manchester and Rochdale turnpike road.
It was a structure of considerable antiquity, and consisted of a
centre and two projecting wings&mdash;an arrangement frequently
met with in the ancient manor-houses of this county&mdash;and bore
evidence of having been erected at two periods.</p>

<p>"Like most other houses of similar pretensions and antiquity,
it was not without its traditionary legends, and the <i>boggart</i> of
Blackley Hall was as well known as Blackley Hall itself. In
the stillness of the night it would steal from room to room, and
carry off the bedclothes from the couches of the sleeping, but
now thoroughly aroused and discomfited inmates."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>The township of Crumpsall bounds Blackley on the north
side, and is divided from it by the lively but now turbid little
river Irk, or Iwrke, or Irke, which means "Roebuck." "From
time immemorial, for ecclesiastical purposes, Crumpsall has been
associated with Blackley." The present Crumpsall Hall stands
on the north side of the Irk, about a mile and a half from
"Boggart Ho' Clough." The earlier orthography of the name
was "Crumeshall, or Curmeshall. For its derivation we are
referred to the Anglo-Saxon, the final syllable 'sal' signifying
in that language a hall or place of entertainment, of which
hospitable abode the Saxon chief, whose name the first syllable
indicates, was the early proprietor. Thus, too, Ordsall in the
same parish." Here, in later days, Humphrey Chetham was
born, at Crumpsall old hall. The author of the "History of
the Ancient Chapel of Blackley," from whose book I gather all
this information, also describes an old farm-house, situated in a
picturesque spot, in the higher part of Crumpsall, and pointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
out as the dwelling in which Hugh Oldham, Bishop of Exeter,
who founded the Manchester Grammar School, was born.
About four years ago, when rambling about the green uplands of
Crumpsall, I called at this farm to see a friend of mine, who
lived in a cottage at the back of the house. While there I was
shown through this curious old dwelling; and I remember that
the tenants took especial pains to acquaint me with its local
importance, as the place of Bishop Oldham's nativity. It is
still known as "Oldham's tenement," and also as "Th' Bongs
(Banks) Farm." The following is a more detailed account of
the place, and the man:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is celebrated as the reputed birthplace of Hugh Oldham,
Bishop of Exeter, who, according to tradition current in the
neighbourhood, was born there about the middle of the fifteenth
century, and it is stated to have been the residence of the Oldhams
for the last four hundred years. The house itself&mdash;a long narrow
thatched building&mdash;bears evidence of considerable antiquity; the
walls appear to have been originally of lath and plaster, which
material has gradually, in many places, given place to brick-work;
and the whole exterior is now covered with whitewash. A room
on the ground-floor is still pointed out as the domestic chapel;
but there are no traces of it ever having been devoted to such use.</p>

<p>"Hugh Oldham, LL.B., Bishop of Exeter, was descended from
an ancient family of that name. According to Dodsworth (MSS.
folio 152), he was born at Oldham, in a house in Goulbourne-street;
but this assertion is contradicted by the testimony of his
other biographers: Wood and Godwin state that he was born
in Manchester, by which they mean not so much Manchester
town as Manchester parish; and Dugdale, in his Lancashire
visitation, states more definitely in what part of the parish,
correcting at the same time the misstatement of the others, 'not
at Oldham, but at Crumpsall, near Manchester.' In 1503 he
was created Archdeacon of Exeter, and in the following year
was raised, through the influence of the Countess of Richmond,
to the see of Exeter. In 1515, having founded the Grammar
School of Manchester, he endowed it with the corn-mills situate
on the river Irk, which he purchased from Lord de la Warre, as
well as with other messuages and lands in Manchester."</p>

<p>In relation to Bishop Oldham, it may be worth notice
that in the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> of Wednesday, January 10th,
1855, I found the following letter respecting a descendant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
of this prelate. This brief notice of an aged and poverty-stricken
descendant of the bishop&mdash;a soldier's wife, who has
followed the fortunes of her husband, as a prisoner of war,
and through the disasters of battle, shipwreck, and imprisonment
in a foreign land&mdash;is not uninteresting:&mdash;"There is now
living in this city a poor, aged woman, who, it appears, is a
descendant of the founder of the Manchester Grammar School,
and who was also (in 1783) the first scholar in the first Sunday
school opened in Manchester. In subsequent years, as a soldier's
wife, she followed the fortunes of her husband in the tented
field, as a prisoner of war, and also in shipwreck. She is in full
possession of her mental powers; and though, in a certain sense,
provided for, I am persuaded that many of those whose <i>Alma
Mater</i> was the Grammar School, and the Sunday school teachers
and scholars, would be delighted to honour her."</p>

<p>Crumpsall, in the chapelry of Blackley, was also the birthplace
of Humphrey Chetham, one of Fuller's Worthies, and a man
whom Manchester has good reason to hold in remembrance.
The following matter relative to the man, and the place of
his birth, is from the same volume:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He was born at his father's residence, Crumpsall Hall, and
was baptised at the Collegiate Church, Manchester, July 15th,
1580. He probably received his education at the Grammar
School of his native town. Associated with his brothers, George
and Ralph, he embarked in trade as a dealer in fustians, and so
prospered in his business that in 1620 he purchased Clayton
Hall, near Manchester, which he made his residence, and subsequently,
in 1628, Turton Tower. 'He signally improved
himself,' writes Fuller, 'in piety and outward prosperity, and
was a diligent reader of the scriptures, and of the works of sound
divines, and a respecter of such ministers as he accounted truly
godly, upright, sober, discreet, and sincere. He was high-sheriff
of the county in 1635, and again in 1648, discharging the place
with great honour, insomuch that very good gentlemen of birth
and estate did wear his cloth at the assize, to testify their unfeigned
affection to him; and two of them (John Hartley and
Henry Wrigley, Esquires), of the same profession with himself,
have since been sheriffs of the county.'</p>

<p>"By his will, dated December 16th, 1651, he bequeathed
&pound;7,000 to buy a fee-simple estate of &pound;420 per annum, wherewith
to provide for the maintenance, education, and apprenticing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
of forty poor boys of Manchester, between the ages of six and
fourteen years&mdash;children of poor but honest parents&mdash;no bastards,
nor diseased at the time they are chosen, nor lame, nor blind, 'in
regard the town of Manchester hath ample means already (if so
employed) for the maintenance of such impotents.' The hospital
thus founded was incorporated by Charles II. In 1700 the
number of boys was increased to sixty, and from 1779 to 1826
eighty boys were annually maintained, clothed, and educated.
In the year 1718 the income of the hospital amounted to
&pound;517. 8s. 4d., and in 1826 it had reached to &pound;2,608. 3s. 11d.</p>

<p>"He bequeathed, moreover, the sum of &pound;1,000 to be expended
in books, and &pound;100 towards erecting a building for their
safe deposit, intending thus to lay the foundation of a public
library; and the residue of his estate (amounting to near &pound;2,000)
to be devoted to the increase of the said library and the support
of a librarian. In 1826 this fund was returned at &pound;542 per
annum. The number of volumes is now about 20,000. Mr.
Chetham died, unmarried, September 20th, 1653, and was
buried at the Collegiate Church, where a monument has recently
been erected to his memory, at the cost of a former participator
in his bounty."</p>

<p>The following description of the house, at Crumpsall, in
which Humphrey Chetham was born, is also given in Booker's
"History of Blackley Chapel:"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Crumpsall Hall, the residence of this branch of the Chethams,
was another specimen of the half-timbered mansions already
described. In design, the same arrangement seems to have been
followed that is met with in many of the halls erected during
the fourteenth and two succeeding centuries&mdash;an oblong pile
forming the centre, with cross gables at each end, projecting
some distance outwards. The framework consisted of a series
of vertical timbers, crossed by others placed transversely, with
the exception of the gables, in the upper part of which the
braces sprang diagonally from the centre or king-post. The
roofs were of high pitch, and extended considerably beyond the
outer surface of the walls, thus not only allowing of a more rapid
drain of water, but also affording a greater protection from the
weather. The hall was of two stories, and lighted chiefly by
bay-windows, an occasional dormer-window in the upper story
rising above the roof, and adding to the effect of the building by
destroying that lineal appearance which it would otherwise have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
assumed. This mansion, though never possessing any great pretensions
to architectural excellence, was, nevertheless, interesting
from the picturesque arrangement of its details, and may be
considered a very creditable example of the middle-class houses
of the period to which it is referred. It occupied a site distant
nearly a quarter of a mile from that of the present hall, and was
taken down about the year 1825."</p>

<p>Well may Fuller, writing of Humphrey Chetham, say, "God
send us more such men!" The "poor boys" of Manchester
may well repeat the prayer, and pray also that heaven may send
after them men who will look to the righteous administration of
the bequests which such men leave behind them.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this sketch, I went down to the Chetham
Library, to copy, from Booker's "History of Blackley," the
foregoing particulars. The day was gloomy, and the great
quadrangle of the college was as still as a churchyard. Going
up the old staircase, and treading as lightly as I could with
a heavy foot, as I went by the principal librarian's room
door, I entered the cloistral gloom of the old library. All
was silent, as I went through the dark array of book-laden
shelves. The sub-librarian was writing in some official volume,
upon the sill of a latticed window, in one of the recesses.
Hearing an approaching foot, he came out, and looked the
usual quiet inquiry. "'Booker's Blackley,'" said I. He went
to one of the recesses, unlocked the door, and brought out
the book. "Will you enter it, sir?" said he, pointing to the
volume kept for that purpose. I did so, and walked on into the
reading room of the library; glancing, as I went in, at Oliver
Cromwell's sword, which hangs above the doorway. There
was a good fire, and I had that antique apartment all to myself.
The old room looked very clean and comfortable, and the hard
oaken floor resounded to the footstep. The whole furniture was
of the most quaint and substantial character. It was panelled all
round with bright old black oak. The windows were latticed,
and the window-sills broad. The heavy tables were of solid
oak, and the chairs of the same, with leather-covered and padded
seats and backs, studded with brass nails. A curiously-carved
black oak bookstand stood near the door, and several antique
mirrors, and dusky portraits, hung around upon the dark panelling.
Among these is the portrait of Bradford the martyr, a native of
Manchester. In the library there is a small black-letter volume,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
entitled, "Letters of Maister John Bradford, a faythful minister
and a syngular pyllar of Christe's Church: by whose great trauiles
and diligence in preaching and planting the syncerity of the
Gospel, by whose most goodly and innocent lyfe, and by whose
long and payneful imprisonments for the maintenance of the
truth, the kingdom of God was not a little aduanced: who also
at last most valiantly and cheerfully gaue his blood for the same.
The 4th day of July. In the year of our Lord 1555." The
portrait of Humphrey Chetham, the founder, hangs immediately
above the old-fashioned fireplace, under the emblazoned arms of
his family. Sitting by the fire, at a little oak table covered
with green baize, I copied the particulars here given, relative
to Chetham's bequest to the people of his native locality. I
could not but lift my eyes now and then towards that solemn
face, inwardly moved by a feeling which reverently said, "Will
it do?" The countenance of the fine old merchant seemed to
wear an expression of sorrow, not unmingled with quiet anger,
at the spectacle of twenty thousand books&mdash;intended as a "Free
Library," though now, in comparison with its possibilities, free
chiefly in name&mdash;twenty thousand books, packed together in
gloomy seclusion, yet surrounded by a weltering crowd of five
hundred thousand people, a great number of whom really hunger
for the knowledge here, in a great measure, consigned&mdash;with
excellent registrative care and bibliopolic skill&mdash;to dusty oblivion
and the worm. It is true that this cunningly-secreted "Free
Library" is open six hours out of the twenty-four, but these
hours fall precisely within that part of the day in which people
who have to work for their bread are cooped up at their occupations.
At night, when the casino, the singing-room, and the
ale-house, and all the low temptations of a great city are open,
and actively competing for their prey, the Chetham Library has
been locked up for hours. I am not sure that the noble-hearted
founder would be satisfied with it all, if he saw the relations of
these things now. It seems all the more likely that he would
not be so, when one observes the tone in which, in his will,
he alludes to the administration of certain other local charities
existing in his own time. After specially naming the class
of "poor boys" for whose benefit his hospital was intended,
he specially excludes certain others, "<i>in regard the town of
Manchester hath ample means already</i>, (<span class="smcap">IF SO EMPLOYED</span>) <i>for the
maintenance of such impotents</i>." Judging, from the glimpse we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
have in this passage, of his way of thinking upon matters of this
kind, it seems likely that, if it were possible to consult him upon
the subject, he would consider it a pity that the twenty thousand
books in the library, and the five hundred thousand people outside
the walls, are not brought into better acquaintance with
each other. So, also, murmurs many a thoughtful man, as he
walks by the college gates, in his hours of leisure, when the
library is closed.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi1"><span class="smcap">Rostherne Mere</span> was a pet theme with a young
friend of mine, and we started together towards that
place, at noon, one Sunday in June. Walking up to
the Oxford Road Station, we paid our sixpences, and
got our tickets to Bowdon, which is the nearest point to Rostherne
Mere, by rail; being four miles from the latter place. The day
was fine, and the sky clear, except where gauzy clouds floated
across it with dreamy grace; as if they had come out for a
holiday. Everything seemed to feel that it was Sunday. The
fields and groves were drest in their best. It was the Sabbath
of the year with them. In a few minutes our fiery steed had
whirled us to Bowdon; and we walked up the wooden steps
that lead from the station. Turning to the left at the top,
we struck into a quiet road that leads in the direction of
Rostherne. Bowdon bells were ringing to church as we walked
along, surrounded by singing birds, and sunshine, and sweet
odours from cottage-gardens by the wayside. Now and then
a young sylph, of graceful face and timid mien, tripped past us,
in the garb of a lady,&mdash;on her way to church, with her books
before her; then a knot of pretty, brown-faced village girls, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
wild flowers in their hands, going the same way, with all the
innocent vivacity of childhood in their look and gait; anon came
slowly wending up the path an old couple, bending with age,&mdash;the
history of a simple life of honourable toil written in their
faces, and their attire wearing that touching air which always
marks the struggle which decent poverty makes to put its best
appearance on. The road, which seemed to be little frequented,
shortly brought us to Ashley Hall, a picturesque woodland
mansion. A fine avenue of ancestral trees shade the walk to
the porch of the old hall, which nestles behind the present
modern building. The outbuildings are antiquated and extensive.
The house still wears the appearance of an abode of
comfort and elegance, bent with that quaint charm which hangs
about all fine, old-fashioned rural dwellings. Nothing seemed to
be stirring in or about the hall, but the wind, the birds, and
the trees; and the two large stone sphinxes in front of the porch
looked like petrified genii, so profound was the repose of this green
nook. Outside the house the grass was growing over everything,
even over the road we walked on, it was creeping. For
some distance the road-side was pleasantly soft to the foot with
springy verdure, and thick-leaved trees overhung the highway,</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>until we began to descend into the green pastures of a little vale,
through which a clear river winds its murmuring way. A
widow lady stood in the middle of the path, waiting till her
little orphan lad and his sister drove a herd of cows from the
field by the water-side. There was the shade of grief on her
pale face, and she returned our salutation with pensive courtesy.
We loitered a few minutes by the gate, and helped the lad and
his sister to gather the cattle, and then went on, thinking of the
affecting group we had left behind us. The wild flowers were
plentiful and fine by the way, especially that little blue-eyed
beauty, the "Forget-me-not," which grew in great profusion
about the hedges. A drove of hungry-looking Irish cattle came
wearily up the road, driven by a frieze-coated farmer, who rode
upon a rough pony, that never knew a groom; and behind him
limped a bare-footed drover, eagerly munching a lump of dry
loaf, as he urged forward a two-days-old calf by a twist in the
tail,&mdash;an old application of the screw-propelling principle, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
is very effectual with all kinds of dilatory animals, with tails
on. He was the very picture of poverty, and yet there was a
gay-hearted archness on his brown face; and he gave us the
"good day" merrily. The very flutter of his rags seemed to
have imbibed the care-defying gaiety of the curious biped they
hung upon,&mdash;with such tender attachment. The whole country
was one tranquil scene of fertile verdure, frequently flat for the
length of a mile or two; but gently-undulated in some places;
and picturesquely wooded. In a vista of nearly two miles, not
a human foot was on the road, but ours; and every sight and
sound that greeted the senses as we sauntered along the blossomy
hedge-side, in the hot sunshine, was serenely-sweet and rural.
Skirting the wall of Tatton Park, we came to a substantial
farmhouse, near the highway, and opening the gate, we walked
up to it, to get a few minutes rest, and a drink. At our request,
a girl at the door of the house brought us a large jug-full of
churn-milk, which, when she had reached us a seat in the
garden, we drank as we sat in the sun. In the yard, a little
fat-legged urchin had crept, with his "porritch-pot," under the
nose of a large chained dog, about twice the size of himself,
and sat there, holding his spoon to the dog's mouth, childishly
beseeching him to "sup it." The good-natured brute kept a
steady eye on us while we were in sight, postponing any notice
of his little playmate. By direction of the goodwife, we took a
by-path which led towards the village. The country folk were
returning from church, and among them a number of little girls,
wearing a head-dress of pure white, but of a very awkward
shape. What was the meaning, or what the use, of the badge
they wore, I could not exactly tell.</p>

<p>We found that, though the village had many pretty cottage
homes, dropped down irregularly among the surrounding green,
it consisted chiefly of one little street of rural houses, of very
pleasant appearance. Here and there, a latticed window was
open to the front, showing a small parlour, scrupulously clean
and orderly; the furniture old-fashioned, substantial, and carefully
polished; and the Bible "gleaming through the lowmost
window-pane," under the shade of myrtle-pots, and fuchsias in
full flower. As we looked about us for the church, a gentleman
in the garb of a clergyman stepped out of one of the houses,
which, though a whitewashed dwelling, of simple construction,
and of no great size any way, still had something peculiarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
attractive in its retired position, and an air of superiority about
the taste and trimness of all its appurtenances. He had a book
in one hand, and leaned forward in his walk,&mdash;not from infirmity,
for he was hale and active,&mdash;but as if to give impetus to
his progress, which seemed to have an earnest purpose somewhere.
This gentleman was the Vicar of Rostherne. We
inquired of him the way to the church. "Come up this way,"
said he, in an agreeable tone, but without stopping in his walk.
"Have you never seen it before?" "Never." "Here it is,
then," he replied, as we entered the church-field at the top of
the knoll. The sudden appearance of the venerable fane, and its
picturesque situation, called forth an involuntary expression of
admiration from us. We walked on slowly, scanning the features
of the solemnly-beautiful scene. The vicar then inquired where
we came from, and when we answered "Manchester," he went
on, "Well, now, I don't at all wonder, nor much object to you
Manchester gentlemen, pent up as you are the whole week,
coming out on a Sunday to breathe a little country air, and to
look on the woods and fields, but I should be better pleased to
see you come in time to attend divine worship, which would be
a double benefit to you. You might easily do it, and it would
enhance the pleasure of your ramble, for you would go home
again doubly satisfied with all that you had seen. Don't you
think you would, now?" It needed no Socratic effort on his
part to obtain our assent to such a sentiment, so kindly expressed.
As we walked on, he brought us dexterously to the north-west
corner of the church, the best point of view, looking down
through the trees, from the summit of the hill on which the
church stands, upon Rostherne Mere in all its beauty. There it
lay, in the bosom of the valley below, as smooth and bright as
a plate of burnished silver, except towards the middle, where
the wind embossed it with fantastic ripples, which shimmered
in the sunlight; and it was all fringed round with the rich
meadows, and plumy woods,&mdash;sloping down to the edge of the
water. From the farther side, a finely-wooded country stretched
away as far as we could see, till the scene ended in a dim amphitheatre
of moorland hills, rising up, from east to west, on the
horizon. In front of us, and about four miles beyond the lake,
the pretty village of Bowdon and its ancient church were clearly
in sight above the woods. It was, altogether, a very beautiful
English scene. And it is a pity that this lovely little oasis is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
better known to the jaded hearts that fret themselves to death in
Manchester, and rush here and there, in crowds, to fill all the
world's telescopes; the majority of them, perhaps, like me, little
dreaming of the existence of so sweet a spot so near them. By
the side of the mere, where the water was as placid as glass,
being sheltered from the wind by the woods on its shelvy banks,
we were delighted with a second edition of the scenery on the
margin, and of the skies above, clearly reflected in the seemingly
unfathomable deeps of the water.</p>

<p>The vicar had left us, and gone into the church, requesting
us, when we had feasted our fill on the outside, to follow him,
and look through the inside of the church. We lifted the latch,
but seeing him addressing a number of young people, who sat
round him in attentive attitude, we shut the door quietly, and
walking round to the porch on the opposite side, went in, on
tiptoe. Standing silent under the organ-loft, we listened, while
he impressed upon his young flock the nature and intent of confirmation,
and the necessity for their understanding the solemn
obligation implied thereby, and devoutly wishing to undertake it,
before they could be admitted to partake of it. "And now,"
said he, "if any of you don't quite understand anything I am
saying to you, don't be afraid to say so. I shall be glad to know
it, that I may make it clear to you. For you must remember,
that it is not what I say to you that will be of use to you, but
what you understand of it." He then consulted them about the
best times in the following week for them to meet him, that he
might assist such as were wishful to prepare for the ceremony.
He asked "Thomas," and "Mary," and "Martha," how four
o'clock would suit them on certain days, and when they whispered
that "half-past seven would suit them better," he replied,
"I dare say it will; and let it be so, then." He then repeated
the pleasure it would give him to meet them at that or any
other hour on certain days next week, to help, and examine
them. It was only changing his dinner hour a little. We
walked quietly out as he began to catechise them, postponing
our examination of the interior till a fitter opportunity.</p>

<p>Rostherne churchyard is a singularly retired spot. A solemn
repose mingles with the natural charms of everything about it,
increased by the antiquity of its relics. Though near the village,
it is approached from it by a gentle ascent, from the head of
which it slopes away, clean out of sight of the village, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
bounded on the west side by a row of sombre old trees, through
which Rostherne Hall is seen, in the midst of woods and gardens.
No other building except the church is in sight; and a sweeter
spot for the life-wearied body to take its last rest in, could hardly
be imagined. As I walked about this quiet grave-yard, which
is environed by scenery of such a serene kind, that nature itself
seems afraid to disturb the repose of the sleepers, upon whose
bed the leaves tremble silently down; and where I could hear
no sounds but a drowsy rustle of the neighbouring trees,&mdash;I
thought of Gray's inimitable "Elegy written in a Country
Churchyard:"&mdash;</p>

<p>This poem&mdash;the finest of the kind in the English language&mdash;might,
with equal fitness, have been written of this peaceful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
churchyard of Rostherne village. Man, whom Quarles calls a
"worm of five feet long," is so liable to have his thoughts
absorbed by the art of keeping himself bodily alive, that
he is none the worse for a hint from the literature of the
churchyard:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">And our hearts, though stout and brave,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Still, like muffled drums, are beating</span><br />
<span class="i2">Funeral marches to the grave.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>We walked over the gravestones, reading the inscriptions, some
of which had a strain of simple pathos in them, such as the
following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ye that are young, prepare to die,</span><br />
<span class="i0">For I was young, and here I lie.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>Others there were in this, as in many other burial-places,
which were either unmeaning, or altogether unsuitable to the
situation they were in. There were several half-sunken headstones
in different parts of the yard, mostly bemossed and dim
with age. One or two were still upright; the rest leaned one
way or other. These very mementoes, which pious care had
set up, to keep alive the memories of those who lay mouldering
in the earth below, were sinking into the graves of those they
commemorated.</p>

<p>At the outside of the north-east entrance of the church, lies
an ancient stone coffin, dug up a few years ago in the graveyard.
Upon the lid of the coffin was sculptured the full-length figure
of a knight, in a complete suit of mail, with sword and shield.
No further clue has been obtained to the history of this antique
coffin and its effigy, than that it belonged to one of the Cheshire
family of Venables, whose crest and motto ("Sic Donec") it
bears. The church contains many interesting monuments, belonging
to this and other families of the old gentry of Cheshire.
Several of these are of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
But the finest and most interesting monuments in the church,
as works of art, are those belonging to the Egerton family, of
Tatton Park. At a suitable time, the sexton occasionally takes
a visitor up to the gate which separates the Egerton seat and
monuments from the rest of the church, and, carefully unlocking
it, ascends two steps with a softened footfall, and leads him into
the storied sanctum of the Lords of Tatton; where, among
other costly monuments, he will be struck by the chaste and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
expressive beauty of a fine modern one, in memory of a young lady
belonging to this family. On a beautiful tomb, of the whitest
marble, the figure of a young lady reclines upon a mattress and
pillow of the same, in the serenest grace of feature and attitude:
and "the rapture of repose" which marks the expression of the
countenance, is a touching translation, in pure white statuary,
of those beautiful lines in which Byron describes the first hours
of death:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Before decay's effacing fingers</span><br />
<span class="i0">Have swept the lines where beauty lingers.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>At the back of the recumbent lady, an exquisite figure of an
angel kneels, and leans forward with delicate grace, watching
over the reposing form, with half-opened wings, and one hand
slightly extended over the dead. The effect of the whole is exceedingly
beautiful, chaste, and saddening. The monument is
kept carefully covered with clean white handkerchiefs, except
when the family is present, when it is uncovered, until their departure.
Before I was admitted to view this beautiful memorial,
I had heard something of the story which it illustrates, and I
inquired further of the sexton respecting it. The old man said
that the young lady had been unwell only a few days previous
to the evening of her death, and on that evening the family
physician thought her so much better, and felt so certainly-expectant
of a further improvement in her health, that he directed
her attendants to get her to repose, and then they might themselves
safely retire to rest for a little while. They did so; and
returning soon, found her still lying precisely as they had laid
her, and looking so placid in feature, that they did not know she
was dead, until they came to find her quite cold. The monument
represents her as she was thus found. As I stood looking upon
this group of statuary, the evening sun shone through the southern
windows of the old church, and the sexton&mdash;who evidently knew
what the effect would be&mdash;lowered the crimson blind of the window
nearest to the monument. This threw a soft rich crimson
hue over the white marble tomb, the figures, and the sculptured
drapery, which gave it an inexpressibly-rich appearance. So
white and clean was the whole, that the white handkerchiefs
which the sexton had taken off the figures, and laid upon the
white basement of the tomb, looked like part of the sculpture.</p>

<p>The church is dedicated to St. Mary. It is proved to have
existed long prior to 1188. The present steeple was erected in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
1741. There is something venerable about the appearance of
an old ecclesiastical building, which continually and eloquently
preaches, without offending. Apart from all questions of doctrines,
formulas, and governments, I often feel a veneration for
an old church, akin to that expressed by him who said that he
never passed one without feeling disposed to take off his hat to it.</p>

<p>The sun was setting westward over the woods, and we began
to think of getting a quiet meal somewhere before we went
back. There is generally an old inn not far from an old church.
"How it comes, let doctors tell;" but it is so; and we begun to
speculate upon the chance of finding one in this case. Going out
of the churchyard at the lowest corner, through a quaint wicket
gate, with a shed over it, a flight of steps led us down into a
green dingle, embosomed in tall trees, and there, in front of us,
stood a promising country "hostelrie," under the screen of the
woods. We looked an instant at its bright window, and its
homely and pleasant appurtenances, and then, with assured minds,
darted in, to make a lunge at the larder. "A well-conducted
inn is a thing not to be recklessly sneered at in this world of
ours, after all," thought I. We sat down in a shady little room
in front, and desired the landlord to get us some tea, with any
substantial stomach-gear that was handy and plentiful. In a
few minutes a snowy cloth was on the table, followed by "neat-handed
Phillis," with the tea things. A profusion of strong tea,
and toast, and fine cream, came next, in beautiful china and glass
ware; the whole crowned with a huge dish of ham and poached
eggs, of such amplitude, that I began to wonder who was to join
us. Without waste of speech, we fell to, with all the appetite
and enjoyment of Sancho at Camacho's wedding. The landlord
kept popping in, to see that we wanted nothing, and to urge
us to the attack; which was really a most needless though a
generous office. After tea, we strolled another hour by the
edge of the water, then took the road home, just as the sun
was setting. The country was so pleasant, and we so refreshed,
that we resolved to walk to Manchester, and watch the sinking
of the summer twilight among the woods and fields by the way.
Our route led by the edge of Dunham Park, and through Bowdon,
where we took a peep at the church, and the expansive view
from the churchyard. There is a fine old yew tree in Bowdon
churchyard, seated around. The road from Bowdon to Manchester
passes through a country which may be truly characterised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
as the market-garden of Manchester. We went on, through the
villages of Altrincham, Sale Moor, and Stretford, thinking of
his words who said,&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>It was midnight when I got to bed, and sank into a sound
sleep, to wake in the morning among quite other scenes. But
while I live, I shall not easily forget "the tranquil charm of
little Rostherne Mere."</p>

<p class="drop-capi1"><span class="smcap">When</span> I was first bound apprentice, I was so thick-set,
and of such short stature for my age, that I began to
be afraid that I was doomed to be a pigmy in size;
and it grieved my heart to think of it, I remember how
anxiously I used to compare my own stunted figure with the
height of other lads younger than me; and seeing myself left so
much below them, I remember how much I longed for a rise in
the world. This feeling troubled me sorely for two or three
years. It troubled me so much, indeed, that, even at church,
when I heard the words, "Which of you, by taking thought,
can add one cubit unto his stature?" the question touched me
with the pain of a personal allusion to my own defect; and,
in those days, I have many a time walked away from service
on a Sunday, sighing within myself, and wondering how much
a cubit was. But I had a great deal of strong life in my little
body; and, as I grew older, I took very heartily to out-door
exercises, and I carefully notched the progress of my growth,
with a pocket-knife, against a wooden partition, in the office
where I was an apprentice. As time went on, my heart became
gradually relieved and gay as I saw these notches rise steadily,
one over the other, out of the low estate which had given me so
much pain. But, as this childish trouble died away from my
mind, other ambitions awoke within me, and I began to fret at
the tether of my apprenticeship, and wish for the time when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
should be five feet eight, and free. Burns's songs were always
a delight to me; but there was one of them which I thought
more of then than I do now. It was,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh for ane-an'-twenty, Tam!</span><br />
<span class="i2">An', hey for ane-an'-twenty, Tam!</span><br />

<span class="i2">An' I saw ane-an'-twenty, Tam!</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>About two years before the wished-for day of my release came,
I mounted a long-tailed coat, and a chimney-pot hat, and began
to reckon myself among the sons of men. My whiskers, too&mdash;they
never came to anything grand&mdash;never will&mdash;but my whiskers
began to show a light-coloured down, that pleased the young
manikin very much. I was anxious to coax that silken fluz
lower down upon my smooth cheeks; but it was no use. They
never grew strong; and they would not come low down; so I
gave them up at last, with many a sigh. The dainty ariels were
timid, and did their sprouting gently. This was one of my first
lessons in resignation. I remember, too, it was about the same
time that I bought my first watch. It was a second-hand silver
verge watch, with large old-fashioned numerals upon the face;
and it cost twenty-one shillings. I had a good deal ado to raise
the price of it by small savings, by working over-hours, and by
the sale of an old accordian, and a sword-stick. Long before
I could purchase it, I had looked at it from time to time as I
passed by the watchmaker's window; which was on the way between
my home and the shop where I was an apprentice. At
last I bore the prize away. A few pence bought a steel chain;
and my eldest sister gave me an old seal, and a lucky sixpence,
to wear upon the chain,&mdash;and I felt for the time as if it
was getting twelve o'clock with my fortunes. A long-tailed
coat; a chimney-pot hat; a watch; a mild promise of whiskers;
a good constitution; and a fair chance of being five feet eight,
or so. No wonder that I began to push out my shins as I went
about the streets. For some weeks after I became possessed of
my watch, I took great pleasure in polishing the case, looking
into the works, winding it up, and setting it right by public
clocks, and by other people's watches. I had a trick, too, of
pulling it out in public places, which commanded the range of
some desired observation. But after a year or so the novelty
wore off, and I began to take less interest in the thing. Besides,
through carelessness and inexperienced handling, I found that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
my watch began to swallow up a great deal of pocket-money, in
new glasses, and other repairs. I was fond of jumping, too, and
other rough exercises; and through this my watch got sadly
knocked about, and was a continual source of anxiety to me.
At last I got rid of it altogether. It had never gone well with
me; but it went from me&mdash;for good; and I was cured of the
watch mania for a long while. In fact, nearly twenty years
passed away, during which I never owned a watch; never,
indeed, very much felt the want of one. When I look back at
those years, and remember how I managed to mark the time
without watch of my own, I find something instructive in the
retrospect. In a large town there are so many public clocks,
and bells, and so many varied movements of public life which
are governed by the progress of the hours, that there is little
difficulty in the matter. But in the country&mdash;in my lonely rambles&mdash;I
learned, then, to read the march of time, "indifferently
well," in the indications of nature, as ploughmen and shepherds
do. The sights, and "shapes, and sounds, and shifting elements,"
became my time-markers; and the whole world was my clock.
I can see many compensations arising from the lack of a watch
with me during that time.</p>

<p>And now, after so many years of sweet independence in this
respect, I find myself, unexpectedly, the owner of a watch once
more. I became possessed of it rather curiously, too. The way
of it was this. I was on a visit to a neighbouring town; and,
in the afternoon, I called to pass an hour with an old friend,
before returning home. After the usual hearty salutes, we sat
down in a snug back parlour, lighted our pipes, and settled into
a dreamy state of repose, which was more delightful than any
strained effort at entertainment. We puffed away silently for a
while; and then we asked one another questions, in a drowsy
way, like men talking in their sleep; then we smoked on
again, and looked vacantly round about the room, and into the
fire. At last, I noticed that my friend began to gaze earnestly
at my clothing; and, knowing him to be a close observer, and a
man of penetrative spirit, I felt it; though I knew very well
that it was all right, for he takes a kindly interest in all I wear,
or do, or say. Well; he began to look hard at my clothing,
beginning with my boots. I didn't care much about him examining
my boots; for, as it happened, they had just been soled,
and heeled, and welted afresh; with a bran new patch upon one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
side. If he had seen them a week before, I should have been
pained, for they were in a ruinous state then; and, being rather
a dandified pair originally, they looked abominable. I think there
is nothing in the world so intensely wretched in outward appearance
as shabby dandyism. Well; he began with my boots;
and, after he had scrutinised them thoroughly for a minute or
two, I felt, instinctively, that he was going to peruse the whole
of my garments from head to foot, like a tapestried story. And
so it was. When he had finished my boots, his eyes began to
travel slowly up my leg; and, as they did so, my mind ran
anxiously ahead, to see what the state of things was upon the
road that his glance was coming. "How are my trousers?"
thought I. There was no time to lose; for I felt his eye coming
up my leg, like a dissecting knife. At last, I bethought me
that I had split my trousers across one knee, about a fortnight
before; and the split had only been indifferently stitched
up. "Now for it," thought I, giving myself a sudden twitch,
with the intention of throwing my other leg over that knee to
hide the split. But I was too late. His eye had already fastened
upon the place like a leech. I saw his keen glance playing slyly
about the split, and my nerves quivered in throes of silent pain
all the while. At last, he lifted up his eyes, and sighed, and
then, looking up at the ceiling, he sighed out the word, "Aye,"
very slowly; and then he turned aside to light his pipe at the
fire again; and, whilst he was lighting his pipe, I very quietly
laid the sound leg of my trousers over the split knee. Pushing
the tobacco into his pipe with the haft of an old penknife, he
now asked me how things were going on in town. I pretended
to be quite at ease; and I tried to answer him with the air of
one who was above the necessity of such considerations. But I
knew that he had only asked the question for the purpose of
throwing me off my guard; and I felt sure that his eyes would
return to the spot where they had left off at. And they did so.
But he saw at once that the knee was gone; so he travelled
slowly upwards, with persistent gaze. In two or three minutes
he stopped again; it was somewhere about the third button of
my waistcoat&mdash;or rather the third button-hole, for the button
was off. He halted there; and his glance seemed to snuff round
about the place, like a dog that thinks it has caught the scent;
and I began to feel uncomfortable again; for, independent of the
button being off, I had only twopence-halfpenny, and a bit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
blacklead pencil, and an unpaid bill in my pocket; and somehow
I thought he was finding it all out. So I shifted a little round,
and began to hum within myself,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Take, oh take those eyes away!</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>But it was no use. He would do it. And I couldn't stand it
any longer; so I determined to bolt before he got up to my shirt
front, or "dickey,"&mdash;for I had a "dickey" on, and one side of it
was bulging out in a disorderly way, and I durst not try to put
it right for fear of drawing his attention to it. I determined to
be rid of the infliction at once, so I pretended to be in a hurry.
Knocking the ashes out of my pipe, I rose up and said, "Have
you got a time-table?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"There's a train about now, I think."</p>

<p>"Yes; but stop till the next. What's your hurry? You're
not here every day. Sit down and get another pipe."</p>

<p>"How's your clock?" said I, turning round and looking
through the window, so as to get a sly chance of pushing my
"dickey" into its place. "How's your clock?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's about ten minutes fast. Isn't it, Sarah?" said he
to the servant, who was coming in with some coals.</p>

<p>"No," replied she. "I put it right by th' blacksmith, this
mornin'."</p>

<p>By "the blacksmith," she meant the figure of an old man
with a hammer, which struck the hours upon the bell of a public
clock, a little higher up the street.</p>

<p>"Well," said my friend, looking at the time-table, "in any
case, you're too late for this train now. Sit down a bit. I left
my watch this morning, to have a new spring put in it; but I'll
keep my eye on the clock, so that you shall be in time for the
next. Sit you down, an' let's have a chat about old times."</p>

<p>I gave a furtive glance at my "dickey," and seeing it was all
right, I sat down again with a sigh, laying the sound leg of my
trousers carefully over my split knee. I had no sooner sat down,
than he looked at my waistcoat pocket again, and said, "I say,
old boy, why don't you carry a watch? It would be a great
convenience."</p>

<p>I explained to him that I had been so many years used to
notice public clocks, and to marking the time by the action of
nature and by those movements of human life that are regulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
by clock-work, that I felt very little need for a watch. Besides,
it was as easy to ask the time of day of people who had watches,
as it would be to look at one's own; and then, if I had a watch,
I did not know whether the convenience of the thing would
compensate for the anxiety and expense of it. He listened attentively,
and then, after looking into the fire musingly for a
minute or two, as if he was interpreting my excuse in some way
of his own, he suddenly knocked his pipe upon the top bar of
the fire-grate, and said, "By Jupiter Ammon, I'll give you one!"
My friend never swears, except by that dissolute old Greek; or
by a still more mysterious deity, whom he calls "the Living
Jingo!" Whenever he mentions either of these, I know that he
means something strong; so I sat still and "watched the case,"
as lawyers say.</p>

<p>"Mary," said he, rising, and calling to his wife, who was in
another room; "Mary, wheer's that old watch?"</p>

<p>"I have it upstairs, in an old rosewood writing-desk," replied
she.</p>

<p>"Just fetch it down; I want to look at it." He listened at
the door, until he heard her footsteps going upstairs; and then
he turned to me, chuckling and rubbing his hands; and, slapping
me on the shoulder, he said, "Now then, old fellow, fill
your pipe again! By the Living Jingo, you shall have the time
o' day in your pocket before you leave this house." She was a
good while in returning; so he shouted up the stairs, "Haven't
you found it yet, Mary?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied she, "it's here. I'll be down in a minute."</p>

<p>I began to puff very hard at my pipe; for I was getting
excited. She came at last, and said, as she laid the watch in his
hand, "I have thought of selling it many a time, for it is of no
use lying yonder."</p>

<p>"Aye," replied my friend, pretending to look very hard at
the works. As long as she remained in the room, he still kept
quietly saying, "Aye, aye," at short intervals. But when she
left the room, he earnestly watched the closing door, and then,
shutting the watch, he came across to me, and, laying it in my
hand, he said, "There, old boy, that's yours. Keep it out of
sight till you get out of the house." And I did keep it out of
sight. But I was more than ever anxious to get away by the
next train, so that I could fondle it freely. It was an old silver
lever watch, without fingers. It was silent, with a silence that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
had continued long; its face was dusty; and the case wore the
cloudy hue of neglect. However, I bore my prize away at last;
and, before the day was over, I had spent eighteenpence upon
new fingers, and sixpence upon a yard-and-a-half of broad black
watered silk ribbon for a guard. Next day, after I had polished
the case thoroughly with whitening, I put on a clean shepherd's
plaid waistcoat, in order to show the broad black ribbon which
led to my watch. Since then, I know not how oft I have stopped
to put it right by the cathedral clock; and I have found sometimes,
as the Irishman did, that "the little divul had bate that
big fellow by two hours in twelve." It is a curious thing, this
old watch of mine; and I like it: there is something so human
about it. It is full of</p>

<p>
Quips, and cranks, and wanton wiles.<br />
</p>

<p>Sometimes the fingers stand still, even when the works are going
on. Even when wound up, it has a strange trick of stopping
altogether for an hour or two now and then, as if smitten with
a fit of idleness; and then it will set off again of its own accord,
like a living thing wakening up from sleep. It stops oftener
than it goes. It is not so much a time-keeper as a standing
joke; and looking at it from this point of view, I am very fond
of this watch of mine. Before I had it, whenever I chanced to
waken in the night time, I used to strike a light, and read myself
to sleep again. But now, when I waken in the night, I suddenly
remember, "Oh, my watch!" Then I listen, and say to myself,
"I believe it has stopped again!" and then, listening more
attentively, and hearing its little pulse beating, I say, "No: there
it goes. Bravo!" And I strike a light, and caress the little
thing; and wind it up. I have great fun with it, in a quiet
way. I believe, somehow, that it is getting used to me; and I
shouldn't like to part with it any more. There is a kind of
friendship growing between us that will last until my own
pulse is stopped by the finger of death. And what is death,
after all; but the stopping of life's watch; to be wound up again
by the Maker? I should not like to lose this old watch of mine
now. It is company when I am lonely; it is diversion when I
am tired; and, though it is erratic, it is amiable and undemonstrative.
I will make it famous yet, in sermon or in song. I
have begun once or twice, "Oh thou!&mdash;--" and then stopped,
and tried, "When I behold&mdash;&mdash;" and then I have stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
again. But I will do it yet. If the little thing had a soul, now,
I fear that it would never be saved; for, "faith without works
is vain." But I have faith in it, though it has deceived me oft.
My quaint old monitor! How often has it warned me, that
when man goes "on tick," it always ends in a kind of "Tic
douloureux." But the hour approaches, when its tiny pulse and
mine must both stand still; for&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi1"><span class="smcap">At</span> the western edge of that quiet tract of Lancashire,
called "The Fylde," lying between Wyre, Ribble,
and the Irish Channel, the little wind-swept hamlet of
Norbreck stands, half asleep, on the brow of a green
ridge overlooking the sea. The windows of a whitewashed cottage
wink over their garden wall, as the traveller comes up the
slope, between tall hedgerows; and very likely he will find all
so still, that, but for wild birds that crowd the air with music,
he could hear his footsteps ring on the road as clearly as if
he were walking on the flags of a gentleman's greenhouse.
In summer, when its buildings are glittering in their annual
suit of new whitewash, and when all the country round looks
green and glad, it is a pleasant spot to set eyes upon&mdash;this quiet
hamlet overlooking the sea. At that time of year it smells
of roses, and of "cribs where oxen lie;" and the little place is
so steeped in murmurs of the ocean, that its natural dreaminess
seems deepened thereby. I cannot find that any great barons
of the old time, or that any world-shaking people have lived
there; or that any events which startle a nation have ever
happened on that ground; but the tranquil charm that fills the
air repays for the absence of historic fame.</p>

<p>There is seldom much stir in Norbreck, except such as the
elements make. The inhabitants would think the place busy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
with a dozen people upon its grass-grown road at once, whatever
the season might be. It is true that on a fine day in summer I
have now and then seen a little life just at the entrance of the
hamlet. There, stands a pretty cottage, of one story, consisting
of six cosy rooms, that run lengthwise; its white walls adorned
with rose trees and fruit trees, and its windows bordered with
green trellis work. Two trim grass-plots, with narrow beds of
flowers, and neat walks, mosaically-paved with blue and white
pebbles from the sea, fill up the front garden, which a low white
wall and a little green gate enclose from the road. In front of
this cottage, I have sometimes seen a troop of rosy children playing
round a pale girl, who was hopelessly infirm, and, perhaps on
that account, the darling of the whole household. I have seen
her rocking in the sun, and, with patient melancholy, watching
their gambols, whilst they strove to please her with all kinds
of little artless attentions. Poor Lucy! Sometimes, after
swaying to and fro thoughtfully in her chair, she would stop
and ask questions that sent her father out of the room to wipe
his eyes. "Papa, are people lame in heaven?" "Papa, are
angels poorly sometimes, like we are here?" ... It is
one of those beautiful compensations that mingle with the mishaps
of life, that such a calamity has often the sweet effect of
keeping kind hearts continually kind. The poor Lancashire
widow, when asked why she seemed to fret more for the loss
of her helpless lad than for any of her other children, said
she couldn't tell, except "it were becose hoo'd had to nurse
him moor nor o' tother put together." Surely, "there is
a soul of good in all things evil." About this pretty cottage,
where little Lucy lived, is the busiest part of the hamlet in
summer time. There may chance to be two or three visitors
sauntering in the sunshine; or, perhaps, old Thomas Smith,
better known as "Owd England," the sea-beaten patriarch of
Norbreck, may paddle across the road to look after his cattle, or,
staff in hand, may be going down to "low water" a-shrimping,
with his thin hair playing in the breeze. Perhaps Lizzy, the
milkmaid, may run from the house to the shippon, with her skirt
tucked up, and the neb of an old bonnet pulled down to shade
her eyes; or Tom, the cow lad, may be leaning against a sunny
wall, whistling, and mending his whip, and wondering how long
it wants to dinner-time. There may be a fine cat dozing on the
garden wall, or gliding stealthily towards the outhouses. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
are the common features of life there. For the rest, the sounds
heard are mostly the cackle of poultry, the clatter of milk cans,
the occasional bark of a dog, the distant lowing of kine, a snatch
of country song floating from the fields, the wild birds' "tipsy
routs of lyric joy," and that all-embracing murmur of the surge
which fills one's ears wherever we go. In Norbreck everything
smacks of the sea. On the grassy border of the road, about
the middle of the hamlet, there is generally a pile of wreck
waiting the periodical sale which takes place all along the coast.
I have sometimes looked at this pile, and thought that perhaps to
this or that spar some seaman might have clung with desperate
energy among the hungry waters, until he sank, overpowered, into
his uncrowded grave. The walls of gardens and farmyards are
mostly built of cobles from the beach, sometimes fantastically
laid in patterns of different hues. The garden beds are edged
with shells, and the walks laid with blue and white pebbles.
Here and there are rockeries of curiously-shaped stones from the
shore. Every house has its little store of marine rarities, which
meet the eye on cornices and shelves wherever we turn. Now
and then we meet with a dead sea-mew on the road, and noisy
flocks of gulls make fitful excursions landward; particularly in
ploughing time, when they crowd after the plough to pick slugs
and worms out of the new furrows.</p>

<p>With a single exception, all the half-dozen dwellings in Norbreck
are on one side of the road, with their backs to the north.
On the other side there are gardens, and a few whitewashed outhouses,
with weatherbeaten walls. The main body of the hamlet
consists of a great irregular range of buildings, formerly the residence
of a wealthy family. This pile is now divided into several
dwellings, in some of which are snug retreats for such as prefer
the seclusion of this sea-nest to the bustle of a crowded watering
place. A little enclosed lawn, belonging to the endmost of the
group, and then a broad field, divides this main cluster from the
only other habitation. The latter seems to stand off a little, as
if it had more pretensions to gentility than the rest. It is a
picturesque house, of different heights, built at different times.
At the landward end, a spacious yard, with great wooden doors
close to the road, contains the outbuildings, with an old-fashioned
weather-vane on the top of them. The lowmost part of the
dwelling is a combination of neat cottages of one story; the
highest part is a substantial brick edifice of two stories, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
attics. This portion has great bow windows, which sweep the
sea view, from the coast of Wales, round by the Isle of Man,
to the mountains of Cumberland. In summer, the white walls
of the cottage part are covered with roses and creeping plants,
and there is an air of order and tasteful rusticity about the
whole; even to the neat coble pavement which borders the
wayside. On the top of the porch a stately peacock sometimes
struts, like a feathered showman, whilst his mate paces to and
fro, cackling on the field wall immediately opposite. There are
probably a few poultry pecking about the front; and, if it happens
to be a sunny day, a fine old English bear-hound, of the
Lyme breed, called "Lion," and not much unlike his namesake
in the main, may be seen stretched in a sphinx-like posture on
the middle of the road, as if the whole Fylde belonged to him, by
right of entail; and slowly moving his head with majestic gaze,
as if turning over in his mind whether or not it would be polite
to take a piece out of the passing traveller for presuming to walk
that way. Perhaps in the southward fields a few kine are grazing
and whisking their tails in the sunshine, or galloping from gap to
gap under the influence of the gad-fly's spur; and it may happen
that some wanderer from Blackpool can be seen on the cliffs,
with his garments flapping in the breeze. Except these, and
the rolling surge below, all is still at this end of the hamlet, unless
the jovial face of the owner appear above the wall that encloses
his outbuildings, wishing the passer-by "the fortune of the day."
Norbreck, as a whole, is no way painfully genteel in appearances,
but it is sweet and serene, and its cluster of houses seems to
know how to be comfortable, without caring much for display.
Dirt and destitution are unknown there; in fact, I was told that
this applies generally to all the scattered population of that quiet
Fylde country. Though there are many people there whose
means of existence are almost as simple as those of the wild bird
and the field mouse, yet squalor and starvation are strangers
amongst them. If any mischance happen to any of these Fylde
folk, everybody knows everybody else, and, somehow, they stick
to one another, like Paddy's shrimps,&mdash;if you take up one you
take up twenty. The road, which comes up thither from many
a mile of playful meanderings through the green country, as soon
as it quits the last house, immediately dives through the cliffs,
with a sudden impulse, as if it had been reading "Robinson
Crusoe," and had been drawn all that long way solely by its love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
for the ocean. The sea beach at this spot is a fine sight at any
time; but in a clear sunset the scene is too grand to be touched
by any imperfect words. Somebody has very well called this
part of the coast "the region of glorious sunsets." When the
waters retire, they leave a noble solitude, where a man may
wander a mile or two north or south upon a floor of sand finer
than any marble, "and yet no footing seen," except his own;
and hear no sounds that mingle with the mysterious murmurs of
the sea but the cry of the sailing gull, the piping of a flock of
silver-winged tern, or the scream of the wild sea-mew. Even
in summer there are but few stragglers to disturb those endless
forms of beauty which the moody waves, at every ebb, leave
printed all over that grand expanse, in patterns ever new.</p>

<p>Such is little Norbreck, as I have seen it in the glory of the
year. In winter, when the year's whitewash upon its houses is
getting a little weather-worn, it looks rather moulty and ragged
to the eye; and it is more lonely and wild, simply because
nature itself is so then; and Norbreck and nature are not very
distant relations.</p>

<p class="pa">&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Penny Stone: a Tradition of the Fylde.</span></p>

<p>It was a bonny day on the 5th of March, 1860, when I visited
Norbreck, just before those tides came on which had been
announced as higher than any for a century previous. This
announcement brought thousands of people from the interior into
Blackpool and other places on that coast. Many came expecting
the streets to be invaded by the tide, and a great part of the level
Fylde laid under water; with boats plying above the deluged
fields, to rescue its inhabitants from the towers of churches and
the tops of farmhouses. Knowing as little of these things as
inland people generally do, I had something of the same expectation;
but when I came to the coast, and found the people
going quietly about their usual business, I thought that, somehow,
I must be wrong. It is true that one or two farmers had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
raised their stacks several feet, and another had sent his "deeds"
to Preston, that they might be high and dry till the waters left
his land again; and certain old ladies, who had been reading the
newspapers, were a little troubled thereby; but, in the main,
these seaside folk didn't seem afraid of the tide.</p>

<p>During the two days when the sea was to reach its height,
Blackpool was as gay, and the weather almost as fine, as if it had
been the month of June, instead of "March&mdash;mony weathers,"
as Fylde folk call it. The promenade was lively with curious
inlanders, who had left their "looms" at this unusual season, to
see the wonders of the great deep. But when it came to pass
that, because there was no wind to help in the water, the tide
rose but little higher than common, many people murmured
thereat, and the town emptied as quickly as it had filled. Not
finding a deluge, they hastened landward again, with a painful
impression that the whole thing was a hoax. The sky was blue,
the wind was still, and the sun was shining clearly; but this was
not what they had come forth to see.</p>

<p>Though some were glad of any excuse for wandering again
by the shores of the many-sounding ocean, and bathing soul
and body in its renovating charms, the majority were sorely
disappointed. Among these, I met one old gentleman, close on
seventy, who declared, in a burst of impassioned vernacular, that
he wouldn't come to Blackpool again "for th' next fifty year,
sink or swim." He said, "Their great tide were nowt i'th
world but an arran' sell, getten up by lodgin'-heawse keepers, an'
railway chaps, an' newspapper folk, an sich like wastril devils,
a-purpose to bring country folk to th' wayter-side, an' hook
brass eawt o' their pockets. It were a lond tide at Blackpool
folk were after;&mdash;an they wanted to get it up i' winter as weel
as summer. He could see through it weel enough. But they'd
done their do wi' him. He'd too mich white in his e'en to be
humbugged twice o'er i'th' same gate, or else he'd worn his yed
a greyt while to vast little end. But he'd come no moor a
seein' their tides, nor nowt else,&mdash;nawe, not if the whole hole
were borne't away,&mdash;folk an' o,' bigod! He did not blame th'
say so mich,&mdash;not he. Th' say would behave itsel' reet enough,
iv a rook o' thievin' devils would nobbut let it alone, an' not go
an' belie it shamefully, just for th' sheer lucre o' ill-getten gain,
an' nowt else.... He coom fro' Bowton, an' he're beawn
back to Bowton by th' next train; an' iv onybody ever see'd him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
i' Blackpool again, they met tell him on't at th' time, an' he'd ston
a bottle o' wine for 'em, as who they were. They had a little
saup o' wayter aside o' whoam that onsert their bits o' jobs i'

be content wi' it for th' futur&mdash;tide or no tide. They met tak
their say, an' sup it, for him,&mdash;trashy devils!" Of course, this
was an extreme case, but there were many grumblers on the
same ground; and some amusement arising out of their unreasoning
disappointment.</p>

<p>Down at Norbreck, about four miles north of Blackpool,
though there was a little talk, here and there, about the curious
throng at the neighbouring watering-place, all else was still as
usual. "Owd England," the quaint farmer and fisherman of
the hamlet, knew these things well. He had lived nearly seventy-four
years on that part of the coast, and he still loved the great
waters with the fervour of a sea-smitten lad. From childhood
he had been acquainted with the moods and tenses of the ocean;
and it was a rare day that didn't see him hobble to "low
water" for some purpose or other. He explained to me that a
tide of much lower register in the tables, if brought in by a
strong wind, would be higher in fact than this one with an
opposite wind; and he laughed at the fears of such as didn't
know much about the matter. "Thoose that are fleyed," said
he, "had better go to bed i' boats, an' then they'll ston a chance
o' wakenin' aboon watter i'th' mornin'.... Th' idea of
a whol teawn o' folk comin' to't seea for this. Pshaw! I've no
patience wi' 'em!... Tide! There'll be no tide worth
speykin' on,&mdash;silly divuls,&mdash;what I knaw. I've sin a fifteen-fuut
tide come far higher nor this twenty-one foot eleven can come
wi' th' wind again it,&mdash;sewer aw hev. So fittin it should,
too.... But some folk knawn nowt o'th' natur o'
things." Lame old Billy Singleton, a weather-worn fisherman,
better known by the name of "Peg Leg," sat knitting
under the window, with his dim eyes bent over a broken net.
"Owd England" turned to him and said, "It wur a fifteen-fuut
tide, Billy, at did o' that damage at Cleveless, where th' bevel-men
are at wark." Old "Peg Leg" lifted his head, and replied,
"Sewer it wor, Thomas; an', by the hectum, that wor a tide!
If we'd hed a strang sou'-west wind, this wad ha' played rickin'
too. I've heeard as there wor once a village, ca'd Singleton
Thorpe, between Cleveless and Rossall, weshed away by a heigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
tide, abaat three hundred year sin'. By the hectum, if that had
happen't i' these days, Thomas, here wod ha' bin some cheeop
trips an' things stirrin' ower it." He then went on mending
his net.</p>

<p>Old bed-ridden Alice, who had spent most of the daylight of
seven years stretched upon a couch under the window, said,
"But it never could touch us at Norbreck,&mdash;nowt o't sooart.
It's nearly th' heighest point i't country; isn't it, uncle?"
"Sartiny," said "Owd England;" "but," continued he, "iv ye
want to see summat worth rememberin', ye mun go to low
watter. It'll be a rare seet. Th' seea 'll ebb far nor ever wor
knawn i'th' memory o' mon; an' here'll be skeers an' rocks eawt
at hesn't bin sin of a hundred year. Iv ye'd like to set fuut o'
greawnd at nobody livin' mun walk on again, go daan with us at
five o'clock o' Friday afternoon." I felt that this would indeed
be an interesting sight, and I agreed to accompany the old fisherman
to low water.</p>

<p>It was a cloudless, summer-like evening, when our little company
of four set out from Norbreck, As we descended the
cliffs, the track of the declining sun's beams upon the sea was
too glorious for eyes to endure; and every little pool and rill
upon the sands gleamed like liquid gold. A general hush pervaded
the scene, and we could hear nothing but our own voices,
and a subdued murmur of the distant waves, which made the
prevailing silence more evident to the senses. "Owd England"
led the way, with his favourite stick in hand, and a basket on
his arm for the collection of a kind of salt water snail, called
"whilks," which, he said, were "the finest heytin' of ony sort
o' fish i'th world for folk i' consumptions." "Ye happen
wouldn't think it," said he, "bod I wor i' danger o' consumption
when I were a young mon." As we went on, now over a firm
swelling sand-bank, now stepping from stone to stone through a
ragged "skeer," and slipping into pools and channels left by the
tide; or wading the water in reckless glee,&mdash;the fine old man
kept steadily ahead, muttering his wayward fancies as he made
towards the silver fringe that played upon the skirts of the sea.
Now and then he stopped to point out the rocks, and tell their
names. "That's th' Carlin' an' Cowt,&mdash;a common seet enough.
Ye see, it's not far eawt.... Yon's 'Th' Mussel Rock,'
deawn to so'thard. Ther's folk musselin' on it neaw, I believe.
But we'll go that way on.... Tak raand bith sond-bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
theer. Yaar noan shod for wadin'; an' this skeer's a varra rough
un.... That's 'Penny Stone,' reight afore you, toward
th' seea. Ye'll hev heeard o' 'Th' Penny Stone Rock,' mony a
time, aw warnd. There wor once a public-heawse where it
stons, i'th owd time; an' they sowd ale there at a penny a pot.
Bod then one connot tell whether it wor dear or cheeop till they
knaw what size th' pot wor&mdash;an' that I dunnot knaw. Mr.
Thornber, o' Blackpool, hes written a book abaat this 'Penny
Stone;' an' I believe at Mr. Wood, o' Bispham Schoo', hes one.
He'll land it yo in a minute, aw warnd. Ye mun send little Tom
wi' a bit ov a note. I never see 'Penny Stone' eawt so as to
get raand it afore.... Neaw, yon far'ast, near low watter,
is 'Th' Owd Woman's Heyd.' I've oft heeard on it, an' sometimes
sin a bit o't tip aboon watter, bod I never see it dry i' my
life afore,&mdash;an' I never mun again,&mdash;never." He then paddled
on, filling his basket, and muttering to himself about this extraordinary
ebb, and about the shortness of human life. The sun
began to "steep his glowing axle in the western wave," and the
scene was melting every moment into a new tone of grandeur.
As we neared the water, the skeers were more rugged and wet,
and, in a few minutes, we picked up a basketful of "whilks,"
and a beautiful variety of the sea anemone. After the sun had
dipped, his lingering glory still crowded the western heavens, and
seemed to deepen in splendour as it died upon the scene; while
the golden ripples of the sea sang daylight down to rest. I never
saw mild evening close over the world with such dreamy magnificence.
We wandered by the water, till</p>

<p>The tide was returning, and the air getting cold; so we went
homewards, with wandering steps, in the wake of our old fisherman,
by way of "Penny Stone Rock." There is a tradition all
over the Fyltle that this rock, now only visible "on the utmost
verge of the retired wave," marks the locality of a once famous-hostelry.
Doubtless the tradition has some foundation in fact, as
the encroachments of the sea upon this coast have been great,
and sometimes disastrous, as in the destruction of the village of
Singleton Thorpe, about a mile and a half to northward, in
1555. In the Rev. W. Thornber's interesting little volume,
called "Penny Stone; or a Tradition of the Spanish Armada,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
he says of the old hostelry associated with this now submerged
rock, "It was situated in a vale, protected from the sea by a
barrier of sand-hills, at a short distance from a village called
Singleton Thorpe, in the foreland of the Fylde, Lancashire.
The site of the homestead was romantic, for it was in the very
centre of a Druidical circle, described in a former tradition of
the country, one of the huge stones of which reared its misshapen
block near the porch. Into this stone a ring had been
inserted by the thrifty Jock, its host, to which he was wont to
attach the horses of his customers whilst they regaled themselves
with a penny pot of his far-famed ale. Hither the whole country
resorted on holidays, to spend them in athletic games, and to
quaff the beloved beverage; nay, so renowned was the hostel,
that 'merrie days of hie away to Penny Stone' was common
even to a proverb. Here lay the secret enchantment of its
popularity. The old distich tell us that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hops, reformation, bays, and beer,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Came into England all in a year.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>Ale was a beverage which had been well known in England,
but in the reign of Henry VIII, it assumed a new name from
the infusion of hops. Now, Jock's father, a cunning lout, was
the first to commence in the Fylde this new, and at that time
mysterious system of brewing, which so pleased the palate of his
customers, that, while others sold their insipid malt liquor at
twopence per gallon, he vended his ale at a penny per pot.
Hence his hostel became known by the name of Penny Stone."</p>

<p>Such is the embodiment Mr. Thornber has given to the
common tradition of "Penny Stone," which we were now
approaching on our homeward way. As we drew near it, we
saw five persons come over the shining sands towards the same
spot; and we heard merry voices ringing in the air. I first
made out my friend Hallstone, in his strong shooting-dress of
light-coloured tweed, and attended by two favourite terriers,
"Wasp" and "Snap." We met at the rock, and I found my
friend accompanied by three "brethren of the mystic tie," one
of whom was Mr. Thornber, the veritable chronicler of "Penny
Stone." The latter had wandered thus far, with his companions,
mainly to avail himself of this rare chance of climbing his pet
legendary crag. His hands were full of botanical specimens from
the sea, and, in his fervid way, he descanted upon them, and
upon the geology of the coast, in a manner which, I am sorry to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
say, was almost lost to my uninitiated mind. I took the opportunity
of inquiring where he found the materials for his tradition.
He answered, that there was no doubt of its fundamental truth;
"but, as to the details wrought into the story," said he, pointing
to his forehead, with a laugh, "I found them in a cellar, deep
down in the rock there."</p>

<p>The gloomy mass was surrounded by a little moat of salt
water, nearly knee-deep, through which we passed; and then,
clinging to its Triton locks of sea-weeds, we climbed to the
slippery peaks of "Penny Stone." The stout lad in attendance
drew a bottle from his basket; and then each in his way celebrated
this unexpected meeting in that singular spot, where we
should never meet together again.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the sombre splendour of the scene, nor
the striking appearance of the group upon that lonely rock,
when the rearward hues of day were yielding their room to
"sad succeeding night." We lingered there awhile; but the air
was cold, and the sea began to claim its own again. Four
then returned by the cliffs to Blackpool, and the rest crossed the
sands hastily to Norbreck, where, after an hour's chat by the
old fisherman's great kitchen fire, I crept to bed, with the sound
of the sea in my ears.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>


<p>A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now, good Peter
Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll: masters, spread yourselves.</p>
<p class="pa">&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Midsummer Night's Dream.</span></p>


<p>The "million-fingered" rain was tapping at the kitchen window
as I sat by "Owd England's" bright hearthstone one forenoon,
hearkening to the wind that moaned outside like a thing in pain.
I could hear by a subdued thump that "Lizzy" was churning
in the dairy; and I knew, by the smell of fresh bread which
came from a spacious out-kitchen, that "Granny" was baking.
"Little Tom," the cow lad, had started early with the cart to
Poulton for coals, making knots on his whiplash as he went
along, to help his memory, which was crowded with orders to
call at one place for meal, at another for mutton, and at others
for physic, and snuff, and such like oddments, wanted by the
neighbours. "Owd England" had gone to the seaside, with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
staff, and his leather strap, to fetch the daily "burn" of firewood;
and&mdash;to see what he could see;&mdash;for every tide brought something.
One day he hauled a barrel of Stockholm tar from the
water; on another, part of the cabin furniture of an unfortunate
steamer; and then a beam of pine was thrown ashore; in all of
which the old man had a certain interest as "wreck-master."
"Peg-leg," the fisherman, was mending a net; and lame Alice
lay, as usual, wrapped up, and in shadow, on the couch under
the window; with her pale face, and a nose "as sharp as a pen,"
turned to the ceiling; while Tib, with her soft legs folded under,
lay basking luxuriously in the fire-shine, dreaming of milk and of
mice. The old clock ticked audibly in the corner, and a pin-drop
silence prevailed in the room. "That's a fine cat," said I.
"Aye," replied old Alice, "isn't it a varra fine cat? It's mother
to that as Missis Alston hes. It cam fra Lunnon, an' it's worth
a deeal o' money, is that cat. The varra day as you cam, it
weshed it face an' sneez't twice,&mdash;it dud, for sewer. Missis
Eastwood wor gettin' dinner ready at th' time, an' hoo said,
'We'st hev a stranger fra some quarter this day, mind i' we
hevn't;' an' directly after, yo cam walkin' into th' heawse, I tell
yo, just as nowt were. I offens think it's queer; bod I've sin
cats as good as ony almanac for tellin' th' weather, an sich like."
"Will it scrat," said I, stroking "Tib" as she stretched and
yawned in my face. "Well," replied Alice, "it's like everything
else for that; it just depends what you do at it. Bod I can onser
for one thing&mdash;it'll not scrat as ill as 'Th' Red Cat' at Bispham
does. I hev sin folk a bit mauled after playin' wi' that." "Aye,
an' so hev I, too," said old "Peg-leg." "I ca'd theer tother neet,
an', by the hectum, heaw they wor gooin' on, to be sewer. I
crope into a corner wi' my gill, there wor sich liltin' agate; an',
ye knaw, a mon wi' one leg made o' wood and tother full o'
rheumatic pains is nowt mich at it. Beside, I've ten a likin' to
quietness,&mdash;one does, ye knaw, Alice, as they getten owd. I geet
aside ov a mon as wor tellin' abeawt Jem Duck'orth, o' Preston,
sellin' his midden. Ye'll hev heeard o' that, Alice?" "Nay,
I don't know as I hev, Billy; what is it? I dud hear at once
th' baillies were in his heawse, an' they agreed to go away if
he'd find 'em a good bondsman. So Jem towd 'em that he had
a varra respectable old friend i'th next room that he thowt would
be bund wi him to ony amount; if they'd let him fotch him. So
they advised him to bring his bond in at once, ah' hev it sattle't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
baat ony bother&mdash;for th' baillies wor owd friends o' Jem's, ye
knaw; an' they didn't want to be hard with him. Well, what
does Jem do, bod go an' fotch a great brown bear as he'd hed
mony a year, an' turns it into th' place where th' baillies were,
baat muzzle; and says, 'Gentlemen, that's my bondsman.' Bod,
never ye mind if th' baillies didn't go through that window, moor
sharper.... I've heard mony a queer tale o' Jem. What's
this abaat th' midden, Billy?" "Well, ye knaw, Jem wor a
good-tempered mon, but full o' quare tricks. He wor varra
strong, an' a noted feighter&mdash;th' cock o'th clod in his day, for
that. An' he kept a deeal o' horses that he leet aat for hire.
Well, he'd once gether't a good midden together fra th' stables,
an' farmers began o' comin' abaat th' yard to look at it; so one
on 'em says, 'Jem, what'll to tak for th' midden?' 'Five paand,'
says Jem. 'Well, I'll gi' tho five paand,' says the farmer. So
he ped him, an' said he'd send th' carts in a day or two. In a
bit, another comes an' axes th' price o'th' midden. Jem stack to
owd tale, an' said 'Five paand, an' cheeop too;' an' th' farmer
gev him th' brass at once. 'Sowd again,' says Jem, 'an' th'
money drawn.' Well, at th' end of o', it happen't at both sets
o' carts cam for th' midden o'th same day, an' there were the
devil's delight agate i'th yard between 'em. At last, they agreed
to send for Jem; so he cam wi' a face as innocent as a flea, an'
wanted to know whatever were to do. 'Didn't I buy this midden,
Jem?' said one. 'Yigh, sure, thae did,' says Jem. 'Well,
an' didn't I pay tho for't at th' same time?' 'Sure, thae did, owd
lad&mdash;reet enough,' says Jem. 'Well, but,' says tother, 'didn't I
buy it on tho?' 'Yigh, thae did,' says Jem, 'an' thae ped me
for't, too, honourably, like a mon,&mdash;an' I'll tak very good care
that nob'dy but yo two hes it.' That wor rayther awkert, ye
knaw, an' I know not heaw they'd end it,&mdash;for Jem wor bad to
manage. They wor tellin' it at th' 'Red Cat' tother neet, bod
I could hardly hear for th' gam at wor afoot. Lor bless you!
There wor a gentleman fra Fleetwood tryin' to donce i'th middle
o'th floor; an' owd Jack Backh'us stood i' one corner, wi' his
yure ower his face, starin' like wild, an' recitin' abaat th' Battle
o' Waterloo. Three chaps sit upo' th' sofa as hed been ower
Wyre, o' day, an' they'd etten so mich snig-pie at th' 'Shard,'
that it hed made 'em say-sick, so Tom Poole were mixin' 'em
stuff to cure it. Another were seawnd asleep on a cheer, an'
little 'Twinkle,' fra Poulton, doncin' abeawt, challengin' him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
feight. An' it wor welly as bad eawtside, for there wor a
trap coom up wi' a lot o' trippers as hed bin to Cleveless, an'
'Bugle Bob' upo' th' box, playin' 'Rule Britannia.' Bod I left
when th' bevel-men fra Rossall began o' comin' in, singin' 'Said
Dick unto Tom,' for I felt my yed givin' way under it."</p>

<p>The song, "Said Dick unto Tom," alluded to by the old man,
is a rude fishing ditty, never printed before, and hardly known
out of the Fylde, to which it relates. I wrote it down from the
recitation of a friend near Norbreck. There is not much in the
words except a quiet, natural tone, with one or two graphic
strokes, which breathe the spirit of the country it originated
from. The tune is a quaint air, which I never heard before.
The song was written some time ago, by William Garlick, a
poor man, and a weaver of "pow-davy," a kind of sail-cloth.
These are the words:&mdash;</p>

<p>Soon after dinner the clouds broke, and it was fine again. I
went to the sea-side; and, after pacing to and fro by the waves
a while, I struck out towards Rossall, through the by-paths
of a wilderness of sand and tall grass, called "Starrins," that
run along the edge of the cliffs. I had scarcely gone a mile
before "the rattlin' showers drave on the blast" again, and the
sky was all thick gloom. Dripping wet, I hurried towards the
hotel at Cleveless, and, darting in, got planted in a snug armchair
by the parlour fire, watching the storm that swept furiously
aslant the window, and splashed upon the road in front. Three
other persons were in the room, one a workman from Rossall
College, hard by, and the other commercial men on their route
to Fleetwood. It is wonderful how much rough weather enhances
the beauty of the inside of a house. "Better a wee bush
than nae bield." Well, we were just getting into talk, when the
door opened, and a humorous face looked in. It was a bright-eyed
middle-aged man, shining all over with wet; a blue woollen
apron was twisted round his waist, and he had a basket on his
arm. Leaning against one door-cheek, and sticking a knife into
the other, he said, "By gobs, didn't I get a fine peltin' out o'
that!... Do yees want any oysters, gentlemen? The
shells is small," said he, stepping forward, "but they're chock
full o' the finest fish in the world. Divul a aiqual thim oysters
has in the wide ocean; mind, I'm tellin' ye.... Taste
that!"&mdash;"Hollo, Dennis!" said one of the company, "how is it
you aren't in Fleetwood?"&mdash;"Well, because I'm here, I suppose,"
said Dennis. "Bedad, ye can't expect a man to be in two places
at once&mdash;barrin' he was a burd. Maybe it's good fortune sent
me here to meet wid a few rale gintlemin. Sorra a one I
met on the way, but rain powrin' down in lashins till the oysters
in my basket began to think they were in the say again."&mdash;"Well,
Dennis," said the traveller, "I'll have a score if you'll tell us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
about the Irishman in the cook's shop.&mdash;Ye will? Then divul
recave the toe I'll stir till ye get both.... Will you take
another score, sir,&mdash;till I tell the tale? It's little chance ye'll have
o' meetin' thim oysters agin&mdash;for they're gettin' scarce....
An' now for the tale," said he, with his knife and his tongue
going together. "It was a man from Nenagh, in Tipperary&mdash;he
was a kind o' ganger on the railway; an' he wint to a
cook-shop in a teawn not far from this, an' says he to the
missis o' the heawse, 'A basin o' pay-soup, ma'am, plaze,'
says he,&mdash;for, mind ye, an Irishman's natterally polite till he's
vext, an' thin he's as fiery as Julius Sayzur. Well, whin she
brought the soup, Paddy tuk a taste mighty sly; an', turnin'
reawnd, says he&mdash;just for spooart, mind&mdash;says he, 'Bedad,
ma'am, your soup tastes mighty strong o' the water.' Well,
av coorse, the woman was vext all out, an' she up an' tould
him he didn't understand good aitin', an' he might lave the
soup for thim that had bin better eddicated. But bowld
Paddy went on witheawt losin' a stroke o' the spoon; an'&mdash;purtindin'
not to hear her&mdash;says he, 'I'll go bail I'll make as
good broth as thim wud a penny candle an' a trifle o' pepper.'
Well, by gobs, this riz the poor woman's dander to the full
hoight, an' she made right at him wid her fist, an' swore by this
an' by that, if he didn't lave the heawse she'd knock him into
the boiler. But Paddy was nigh finishin' his soup, an' he made
up his mind to take the last word; an' says he, 'Bi the powers!
that'll be the best bit o' mate ever went into your pan, ma'am;'
an' wi' that, he burst into a laugh, an' the philanderin' rogue up
an' towld her how he said it all for divarshun; an' divul a better
soup he tasted in his life. Well, she changed her tune, like a
child. Bedad, it was like playin' a flute, or somethin'. An',
mind ye, there's nothin' like an Irishman for gettin' the right
music out of a woman&mdash;all the world over. So my tale's
inded, an' I'd like to see the bottom o' my basket. Ye may as
well brake me, gintlemen. There's not more nor five score.
Take the lot; an' let me go home; for I've a long step to the
fore, an' I'm wet to the bone; an' the roads is bad after dark."</p>

<p>After a good deal of pleasantry, Dennis got rid of his oysters;
and, as the storm was still raging without, he called for a
glass, just, as he said, "to keep the damp away from the
spark in his heart, more by token that he had no other fire
to dry his clothes at. But, begorra, for the matter o' that,"
said he, "they're not worth a grate-full o' coals. Look at my
trousers. They're on the varge o' superannuation; an' they'll
require a substitute before long, or else, I'm thinking, they'll not
combine daycently. How an' ever, gintlemen," continued he,
"here's hopin' the fruition of your purses may never fail ye, nor
health to consign their contents to utility. An' neaw," said he,
lighting his pipe, and putting the empty basket on his head like
a cowl, "I must go, if the rain comes in pailfuls, for I'm not
over well; an' if I could get home wud wishin', I'd be in bed
by the time ye'd say 'trap-sticks!' But dramin' an' schamin's
neither ridin' nor flyin', so I'll be trampin', for there's no more
use in wishin' than there would be in a doctor feelin' a man's
pulse through a hole in a wall wid the end of a kitchen poker.
An' neaw, I'll be proud if any gintleman will oblige me by
coming a couple o' mile an the road, to see the way I'll spin
over the greawnd.... Ye'd rather not? Well; fun an' fine
weather's not always together, so good bye, an' long life to yees!"
and away went Dennis through the rain towards Fleetwood.</p>

<p>Waiting for the shower to abate, I sat a while; and, as one
of the company had been to a funeral, it led to a conversation
about benefit societies; in relation to which, one person said he
decidedly objected to funeral benefits being allowed to people
who had died by their own hands, because it would encourage
others to commit suicide. From this we glided to the subject
of consecrated ground; and a question arose respecting a
man who had been accidentally buried partly in consecrated and
partly in unconsecrated ground,&mdash;as to what result would ensue
from that mistake to the poor corpse in the end of all. The
doubt was as to whose influence the unconsecrated half came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
under. The dispute ran high, without anybody making the
subject clearer, so I came away before the shower was over.</p>

<p>Next day I went to Blackpool; and, while awaiting at the
station the arrival of a friend of mine, I recognised the familiar
face of an old woman whom I had known in better days. Tall
and thin, with a head as white as a moss-crop, she was still
active, and remarkably clean and neat in appearance. Her
countenance, though naturally melancholy, had still a spice of
the shrew in it. "Eh," said she, "I'm glad to see you. It's
seldom I have a chance of meeting an old face now, for I'm
seldom out." She then told me she had been two years and a
half housekeeper to a decrepid old gentleman and his two maiden
sisters, in a neighbouring town. "But," said she, "I'm going to
leave. You see I've got into years; and, though I'm active&mdash;thank
God&mdash;yet, I'm often ill; and people don't like to be
troubled with servants that are ill, you know. So I'm forced to
work on, ill or well; for I'm but a lone woman, with no friends
to help me, but my son, and he's been a long time in Canada,
and I haven't heard from him this three years. I look out for
th' postman day by day,&mdash;but nothing comes. Sometimes I
think he's dead. But the Lord knows. It's like to trouble one,
you're sure. It's hard work, with one thing and another, very;
for I 'have to scratch before I can peck,' as th' saying is, and
shall to th' end o' my day, now. But if you can hear of anything
likely, I wish you would let me know,&mdash;for leave yonder
I will. I wouldn't stop if they'd hang my hair wi' diamonds,&mdash;I
wouldn't indeed. I've said it, an' signed it,&mdash;so there's an end.
But what, they'll never ask me to stop, I doubt. It's very hard.
You see I have to keep my son's little boy in a neighbour's
house,&mdash;this is him,&mdash;and that eats up nearly all my bit o'
wage; and where's my clothing to come from? But, don't you
see, yon people are greedy to a degree. Lord bless you! They'd
skin three devils for one hide,&mdash;they would for sure. See yo;
one day&mdash;(here she whispered something which I didn't exactly
catch)&mdash;they did indeed! As Missis Dixon said, when I met
her in Friargate, on Monday forenoon, 'It was a nasty, dirty
trick!' But I've had my fill, an' I shall sing 'Oh, be joyful'
when my time's up. I shall be glad to get to my own country
again,&mdash;yes, if I have to beg my bread. See; they're actually
afraid of me going out o'th house for fear I should talk about
them to th' neighbours. Bless you, they judge everybody by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
theirselves. But I'd scorn the action! It is just as Missis Smith
said, 'They're frightened o'th world being done before they've
done wi' th' world,'&mdash;they are for sure. Such gripin', grindin'
ways! They'll never prosper,&mdash;never." "And is this your
grandson?" said I. "Yes; an' he's a wonderful child for his
age. He's such a memory. His father was just same. I often
think he'd make a rare 'torney, he remembers things so, and he
has such queer sayings. I've taught him many a piece off by
heart. Come, George, say that little piece for this gentleman.
Take your fingers out of your mouth. Come now." The lad
looked a minute, and then rattled out,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Said Aaron to Moses, aw'll swap tho noses:&mdash;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>"Oh, for shame," said she; "not that." But he went on,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Said Moses to Aaron, thine's sich a quare un.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>"For shame," said she. "You see they teach him all sorts o'
nonsense; and he remembers everything. Come, be quick;
'Twinkle, twinkle,'" But here the train was ready; and in
five minutes more she was on her way to Preston; and, not
finding my friend, I walked home along the cliffs.</p>

<p>In my rambles about Norbreck, I met with many racy characters
standing in relief among their neighbours, and marked
with local peculiarities, as distinctly as anything that grows from
the soil. In a crowded city they might be unnoticed; but, amid
"the hamlet's hawthorn wild," where existence seems to glide as
noiselessly as a cloud upon a summer sky&mdash;save where friendly
gossips meet, like a choir of crickets, by some country fire&mdash;they
are threads of vivid interest woven into the sober web of life;
and, among their own folk, they are prized something like those
old books which people hand from generation to generation,&mdash;because
they bear the quaint inscriptions of their forefathers. In
my wanderings I had also the benefit of a genial and intelligent
companion; and, whether we were under his own roof, among
books, and flowers, and fireside talk about the world in the distance,
or roving the green lanes and coppice-trods, chatting with
stray villagers by the way, or airing ourselves in the wind, "on
the beached margent of the sea," I found pleasure and assistance
in his company, in spite of all our political differences. My
friend, Alston, lives about a mile down the winding road
from Norbreck, in a substantial hall, built about a hundred
years ago, and pleasantly dropt at the foot of a great natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
embankment, which divides the low-lying plain from the sea.
The house stands among slips of orderly garden and plantation,
with poultry yards and outhouses at the north-east end. The
green country, sparely sprinkled with white farmhouses and cottages,
spreads out in front, far and wide, to where the heathery
fells of Lancashire bound the eastward view. The scene is as
quiet as a country church just before service begins, except where
the sails of a windmill are whirling in the wind, or the fleecy
steam-cloud of a distant train gushes across the landscape, like a
flying fountain of snow. On a knoll behind the house there is
a little rich orchard, trimly hemmed in by thick thorn hedges.
In March I found its shadeless walks open to the cold sky, and
all its holiday glory still brooding patiently down in the soil; but
I remember how oft, in summer, when the boughs were bending
to the ground with fruit, and the leaves were so thick overhead,
that the sunshine could only find its way through chinks of the
green ceiling, we have pushed the branches aside, and walked
and talked among its bowery shades; or, sitting on benches at
the edge of the fish-pond, have read and watched our floats, and
hearkened the birds, until we have risen, as if drawn by some
fascination in the air, and gone unconciously towards the sea
again. There we have spent many a glorious hour; and there,
at certain times of the day, we should meet with "Quick," or
"Mitch," or some other coast-guardsmen belonging to the gunboat's
crew at Fleetwood, pacing to and fro, on the look-out for
Frenchmen, smugglers, and wreck. As we returned from the
shore one afternoon last March, an old man was walking on the
road before us, carrying what looked in the distance like two milk
pails. These he set down now and then, and looked all round.
My friend told me that this part of the Fylde was famous for
singing-birds, especially larks. He said that bird-catchers came
from all parts of Lancashire, particularly Manchester, to ply
their craft there; and he would venture a guess that the quaint
figure before us was a Manchester bird-catcher, though it was
rather early in the season. When we overtook the old man,
who had set down his covered cages in a by-lane, we found that
he was a bird-catcher, and from Manchester, too. I learnt, also,
that it was not uncommon for a clever catcher to make a pound
a day by his "calling."</p>

<p>The primitive little whitewashed parish church of Bispham
was always an interesting object to me. It stands on a knoll,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
about a quarter of a mile over the fields from Norbreck; and its
foundation is of great antiquity. Its graveyard contains many
interesting memorials, but none more solemnly eloquent than a
certain row of green mounds covering the remains of the unknown
drowned washed upon that coast from time to time. Several of
these, which drifted ashore after the burning of the <i>Ocean Monarch</i>
off the coast of Wales, in 1848, now lie mouldering together in
this quiet country graveyard, all unknown, save a lady from Bury,
in Lancashire, to whose memory a tombstone is erected here.</p>

<p>As the great tides declined, the weather began to be troubled
with wintry fits; but when the day of my return came, it brought
summer again. After dinner, at Bispham House, I went up with
my friend to bid farewell to "Owd England" at Norbreck; and
it was like parting with some quaint volume of forgotten lore.
Nursed here in the lap of nature, the people and customs of the
country were part of himself; and his native landscape, with all
the shifting elements in the scene, was a kind of barometer, the
slightest changes of which were intelligible to him. At the
eastern edge of Norbreck, a low wall of coble stones encloses
his garden. Here, where I have sometimes made a little havoc
among his "Bergamots," "Old Keswicks," and "Scotch Bridgets,"
we walked about, whilst I took a parting look at the landscape.
Immediately behind us the sea was singing its old song; and
below lay the little rural parish, "where," as I heard the rector
say in one of his sermons, "a man cannot walk into the open air
but all his neighbours can see him." Beyond, the tranquil Fylde
stretches out its drowsy green, now oblivious of all remembrance
of piratical ravage, which so often swept over it in ancient
times. Yonder, the shipping of Fleetwood is clearly in sight
to the north. And there, a sunbeam, stealing between the
fleecy clouds, glides across the land from field to field, with a
kind of plaintive grace, as if looking for a lost garden. Over
meadow, over wood, and little town it goes, dying away upon
yon rolling hills in the east. The first of these hills is Longridge,
and behind it, weird old Pendle, standing in a world of its own,
is dimly visible. Northward, the hills roll on in bold relief,
Parlick, and Bleasdale, and the fells between Morecambe and
"time-honoured Lancaster." Still northward, to where yon
proud brotherhood of snow-crowned giants&mdash;the mountains of
Cumberland and Westmorland&mdash;look so glorious in the sunlight;
awaking enchanting dreams of that land of romance, the "Lake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
District," hallowed by so many rich associations of genius. They
toss their mighty heads on westward, till solemn old "Black
Coombe" dips into the Irish Sea. Altogether a fine setting for
the peaceful scene below.</p>

<p>The afternoon was waning, so, taking leave of the old fisherman
and his household, I turned from Norbreck like a man who
rises from his dinner before he is half satisfied. Accompanied
by my friend, I walked four miles, on highways and by-ways,
to meet the train at Poulton. The road was pleasant, and the
day was fine; and I reached Manchester before midnight, feeling
better in soul and body for my sojourn by the sea.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi1"><span class="smcap">There</span> is one feature of the distress in Lancashire
which was very remarkable upon the streets of our
large towns during the year 1862. I allude to the
wandering minstrelsy of the unemployed. Swarms of
strange, shy, sad-looking singers and instrumental performers, in
the work-worn clothing of factory operatives, went about the
city, pleading for help, in touching wails of simple song,&mdash;like
so many wild birds driven by hard weather to the haunts
of man. There is something instructive, as well as affecting, in
this feature of the troubled time. These wanderers are only a
kind of representative overflow of a vast number whom our
streets will never see. Any one well acquainted with Lancashire
will know how wide-spread the study of music is among
its working population. Even the inhabitants of our large towns
know something more about this now than they knew a few
months ago. I believe there is no part of England in which
the practice of sacred music is so widely and lovingly pursued
amongst the working people as in the counties of Lancashire and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
Yorkshire. There is no part of England where, until lately,
there have been so many poor men's pianos, which have been
purchased by a long course of careful savings from the workman's
wages. These, of course, have mostly been sold during the hard
times, to keep life in the owner and his family. The great
works of Handel, Haydn, Beethoven, and Mozart, have solaced
the toil of thousands of the poorest working people of Lancashire.
Anybody accustomed to wander among the moorlands
of the country will remember how common it is to hear the
people practising sacred music in their lonely cottages. It is not
uncommon to meet working men wandering over the wild hills,
"where whin and heather grow," with their musical instruments,
to take part in some village oratorio many miles away.
"That reminds me," as tale-tellers say, of an incident among
the hills, which was interesting, though far from singular in my
experience. Up in the forest of Rosendale, between Derply
Moor and the wild hill called Swinshaw, there is a lone valley,&mdash;a
green cup in the mountains,&mdash;called "Dean." The inhabitants
of this valley are so notable for their love of music, that
they are known all through the vales of Rossendale as "Th'
Deighn Layrocks," or "The Larks of Dean." In the twilight
of a glorious Sunday evening, in the height of summer, I was
roaming over the heathery waste of Swinshaw, towards Dean,
in company with a musical friend of mine, who lived in the
neighbouring clough, when we saw a little crowd of people
coming down a moorland slope, far away in front of us. As
they drew nearer, we found that many of them had musical
instruments; and when we met, my friend recognised them as
working people living in the district, and mostly well known to
him. He inquired where they had been; and when they told
him that they had "bin to a bit of a sing deawn i'th Deighn,"
"Well," said he, "can't we have a tune here?" "Sure, yo con,
wi' o' th' pleasur' i'th world," replied he who acted as spokesman;
and a low buzz of delighted consent ran through the rest
of the company. They then ranged themselves in a circle around
their conductor, and they played and sang several fine pieces of
psalmody, upon the heather-scented mountain top. As those
solemn strains floated over the wild landscape, startling the moorfowl
untimely in his nest, I could not help thinking of the hunted
Covenanters of Scotland. The all-together of that scene upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
the mountains, "between the gloaming and the mirk," made an
impression upon me which I shall not easily forget. Long after
we parted from them we could hear their voices, softening in
sound as the distance grew, chanting on their way down the
echoing glen; and the effect was wonderfully fine. This little
incident upon the top of Swinshaw is representative of things
which often occur in the country parts of Lancashire, showing
how wide-spread the love of music is among the working classes
there. Even in great manufacturing towns, it is very common,
when passing cotton mills at work, to hear some fine psalm tune
streaming in chorus from female voices, and mingling with the
spoom of thousands of spindles. The "Larks of Dean," like the
rest of Lancashire operatives, must have suffered in this melancholy
time; but I hope that the humble musicians of our county
will never have occasion to hang their harps upon the willows.</p>

<p>Now, when fortune has laid such a load of sorrow upon the
working people of Lancashire, it is a sad thing to see so many
workless minstrels of humble life "chanting their artless notes in
simple guise" upon the streets of great towns, amongst a kind of
life they are little used to. There is something very touching,
too, in their manner and appearance. They may be ill-shod
and footsore; they may be hungry, and sick at heart, and forlorn
in countenance; but they are almost always clean and wholesome-looking
in person. They come singing in twos and threes, and
sometimes in more numerous bands, as if to keep one another in
countenance. Sometimes they come in a large family all together,
the females with their hymn-books, and the men with
their different musical instruments,&mdash;bits of pet salvage from the
wrecks of cottage homes. The women have sometimes children
in their arms, or led by the hand; and they sometimes carry
music-books for the men. I have seen them, too, with little
handkerchiefs of rude provender for the day. As I said before,
they are almost invariably clean in person, and their clothing is
almost always sound and seemly in appearance, however poor
and scanty. Amongst these poor wanderers there is none of
the reckless personal negligence and filth of hopeless reprobacy;
neither is there a shadow of the professional ostentation of poverty
amongst them. Their faces are sad, and their manners very often
singularly shame-faced and awkward; and any careful observer
would see at a glance that these people were altogether unused
to the craft of the trained minstrel of the streets. Their clear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
healthy complexion, though often touched with pallor,&mdash;their
simple, unimportunate demeanour, and the general rusticity of
their appearance, shows them to be</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">Suppliants who would blush</span><br />
<span class="i0">To wear a tatter'd garb, however coarse;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Whom famine cannot reconcile to filth;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who ask with painful shyness, and refused,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Because deserving, silently retire.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>The females, especially the younger ones, generally walk behind,
blushing, and hiding themselves as much as possible. I
have seen the men sometimes walk backwards, with their faces
towards those who were advancing, as if ashamed of what they
were doing. And thus they went wailing through the busy
streets, whilst the listening crowd looks on them pityingly and
wonderingly, as if they were so many hungry shepherds from
the mountains of Calabria. This flood of strange minstrels partly
drowned the slang melodies and the monotonous strains of ordinary
street musicians for a while. The professional gleeman
"paled his ineffectual fire" before these mournful songsters. I
think there never was so much sacred music heard upon the
streets of Manchester before. With the exception of a favourite
glee now and then, their music consisted chiefly of fine psalm
tunes,&mdash;often plaintive old strains, known and welcome to all,
because they awaken tender and elevating remembrances of life.
"Burton," "French," "Kilmarnock," "Luther's Hymn," the
grand "Old Hundred," and many other fine tunes of similar
character, have floated daily in the air of our city for months
together. I am sure that this choice does not arise from the
minstrels themselves having craft enough to select "a mournful
muse, soft pity to infuse." It is the kind of music which has
been the practice and pleasure of their lives; and it is a fortuitous
thing that now, in addition to its natural plaintiveness, the
sad necessity of the times lends a tender accompaniment to their
simplest melody. I doubt very much whether Leech's minor
tunes were ever heard upon our streets till lately. Leech was a
working man, born near the hills, in Lancashire; and his anthems
and psalm tunes are great favourites among the musical population,
especially in the country districts. Leech's harp was tuned
by the genius of sorrow. Several times, lately, I have heard the
tender complaining notes of his psalmody upon the streets of the
city. About three months ago I heard one of his most pathetic
tunes sung in the market-place, by an old man and two young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
women. The old man's dress had the peculiar hue and fray of
factory work upon it, and he had a pair of clogs upon his
stockingless feet. They were singing one of Leech's finest
minor tunes, to Wesley's hymn:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And am I born to die,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To lay this body down?</span><br />
<span class="i0">And must my trembling spirit fly</span><br />
<span class="i0">Into a world unknown?</span><br />
<span class="i0">A land of deepest shade,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Unpierced by human thought;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The dreary country of the dead,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where all things are forgot.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>It is a tune often sung by country people in Lancashire at
funerals; and, if I remember right, the same melody is cut upon
Leech's gravestone, in the old Wesleyan chapelyard at Rochdale.
I saw a company of minstrels of the same class going through
Brown-street the other day, playing and singing,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In darkest shades, if Thou appear,</span><br />
<span class="i0">My dawning is begun.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>The company consisted of an old man, two young men, and
three young women. Two of the women had children in their
arms. After I had listened to them a little while, thinking the
time and the words a little appropriate to their condition, I
beckoned to one of the young men, who came "sidling" slowly
up to me. I asked him where they came from, and he said,
"Ash'n." In answer to another question, he said, "We're o'
one family. Me an' yon tother's wed. That's his wife wi' th'
chylt in her arms; an' hur wi' th' plod shawl on's mine" I
asked if the old man was his father. "Ay," replied he; "we're
o' here, nobbut two. My mother's ill i' bed, an' one o' my
sisters is lookin' after her." "Well, an' heaw han yo getten
on?" said I. "Oh, we'n done weel; but we's come no moor,"
replied he. Another day, there was an instrumental band of
these operatives playing sacred music close to the Exchange
lamp. Amongst the crowd around, I met with a friend of
mine. He told me that the players were from Stalybridge.
They played some fine old tunes, by desire, and, among the rest,
they played one called "Warrington." When they had played
it several times over, my friend turned to me and said, "That
tune was composed by a Rev. Mr. Harrison, who was once
minister of Cross-street Unitarian Chapel, in Manchester; and
one day an old weaver, who had come down from the hills,
many miles, staff in hand, knocked at the minister's door, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
asked if there was 'a gentleman co'de Harrison lived theer?'
'Yes.' 'Could aw see him?' 'Yes." When the minister came
to the door, the old weaver looked hard at him for a minute,
and said, 'Are yo th' mon 'at composed that tune co'de Warrington?'
'Yes,' replied the minister, 'I believe I am.' 'Well,'
said the old weaver, 'gi' me your hond! It's a good un!' He
then shook hands with him heartily again; and, saying 'Well,
good day to yo,' he went his way home again, before the old
minister could fairly collect his scattered thoughts.</p>

<p>I do not know how it is that these workless minstrels are
gradually becoming rarer upon the streets than they were a few
months ago. Perhaps it is because the unemployed are more
liberally relieved now than they were at first. I know that,
now, many who have concealed their starving condition are
ferreted out, and relieved as far as possible. Many of these
street wanderers have gone home again, disgusted, to pinch out
the hard time in proud obscurity; and there are some, no doubt,
who have wandered away to other parts of England. Of these
last, we may naturally expect that a few may become so reconciled
to a life of wandering minstrelsy, that they may probably
never return to settled labour again. But "there's a divinity that
shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we will." Let us trust
that the Great Creator may comfort and relieve them, "according
to their several necessities, giving them patience under their
sufferings, and a happy issue out of all their afflictions."</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi1"><span class="smcap">One</span> Saturday a little incident fell in my way, which I
thought worth taking note of at the time. On that
day I went up to Levenshulme, to spend the afternoon
with an old friend of mine, a man of studious habits,
living in a retired part of that green suburb. The time went
pleasantly by whilst I was with the calm old student, conversing
upon the state of Lancashire, and the strange events which were
upheaving the world in great billows of change,&mdash;and drinking
in the peaceful charm which pervaded everything about the man,
and his house, and the scene which it stood in. After tea, he
came with me across the fields to the Midway Inn, on Stockport
Road, where the omnibuses call on their way to Manchester.
It was a lovely evening, very clear and cool, and twilight was
sinking upon the scene. Waiting for the next omnibus, we
leaned against the long wooden watering-trough, in front of the
inn. The irregular old building looked picturesque in the soft
light of declining day; and all around was so still that we could
hear the voices of bowlers who were lingering upon the green,
off at the north side of the house, and retired from the highway
by an intervening garden. The varied tones of animation, and
the phrases uttered by the players on different parts of the green,
came through the quiet air with a cheery ring. The language
of the bowling-green sounds very quaint to people unused to the
game.</p>

<p>"Too much land, James!" cries one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bravo, bully-bowl! That's th' first wood! Come again
for more!" cries another.</p>

<p>"Th' wrong bias, John!"</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"A good road, but it wants legs!"</p>

<p>"Narrow; narrow, o' to pieces!"</p>

<p>These, and such like phrases of the game, came distinctly
from the green into the highway in that quiet evening. And
here I am reminded, as I write, that the philosophic Dr. Dalton
was a regular bowler upon Tattersall's green, at Old Trafford.
These things, however, are all aside from the little story which
I wish to tell.</p>

<p>As we stood by the watering-trough, listening to the voices of
the bowlers, and to the occasional ringing of bells, mingled with
a low buzz of merriment inside the house, there were many
travellers walked by. They came, nearly all of them, from the
Manchester side; sometimes three or four in company, and
sometimes a lonely straggler. Some of them had poor-looking
little bundles in their hands; and, with a few exceptions, their
dress, their weary gait, and dispirited looks, led me to think that
many of them were unemployed factory operatives, who had
been wandering away to beg where they would not be known.
I have met so many shame-faced, melancholy people in that
condition during the last few months, that, perhaps, I may
have somewhat overjudged the number of those who belong to
that class. But, in two or three cases, little snatches of conversation,
uttered by them as they went by, plainly told that, so
far as the speakers went, it was so; and at last a little thing befel
which, I am sure, represented the condition of many a thousand
more in Lancashire just now. Three young women stopped on
the footpath in front of the inn, close to the place where we
stood, and began to talk together in a very free, open way;
quite careless of being overheard. One of them was a stout,
handsome young woman, about twenty-three. Her dress was
of light printed stuff, clean and good. Her round, ruddy arms,
her clear, blonde complexion, and the bright expression of her
full, open countenance, all indicated health and good nature. I
guessed from her conversation, as well as from her general
appearance, that she was a factory operative, in full employ&mdash;though
that is such a rare thing in these parts now. The other
two looked very poor and downhearted. One was a short,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
thick-set girl, seemingly not twenty years of age; her face was
sad, and she had very little to say. The other was a thin, dark-haired,
cadaverous woman, about thirty years of age, as I supposed;
her shrunk visage was the picture of want; and her frank,
childlike talk showed great simplicity of character. The weather
had been wet for some days previous; and the clothing of the
two looked thin and shower-stained. It had evidently been
worn a good while, and the colours were faded. Each of them
wore a poor, shivery bit of shawl, in which their hands were
folded, as if to keep them warm. The handsome lass, who
seemed to be in good employ, knew them both; but she showed
an especial kindness towards the eldest of them. As these two
stood talking to their friend, we did not take much notice of
what they were saying, until two other young women came
slowly from townwards, looking poor, and tired, and ill, like the
first. These last comers instantly recognised two of those who
stood talking together in front of the inn, and one of them said
to the other,&mdash; </p>

<p>"Eh, sitho; there's Sarah an' Martha here! Eh, lasses; han
<i>yo</i> bin a-beggin', too?"</p>

<p>"Aye, lass; we han," replied the thin, dark-complexioned
woman. "Aye, lass; we han. Aw've just bin tellin' Ann,
here. Aw never did sich a thing i' my life afore,&mdash;never! But
it's th' first time and th' last, for me,&mdash;it is that! Aw'll go
whoam; an' aw'll dee theer, afore aw'll go a-beggin' ony moor,&mdash;aw
will for sure! Mon, it's sich a nasty, dirty job; aw'd as

an' me&mdash;we set eawt this mornin' to go to Gorton
Tank, becose we yerd that it wur sich a good place. But one
doesn't know wheer to go to these times; an' one doesn't like to
go a-beggin' among folk at they known. Well, when we coom
to Gorton we geet two-pence-hawpenny theer,&mdash;an' that wur o'.
There's plenty moor beggin' beside us! Well, at after that twopence-hawpenny,
we geet twopence moor; an' that's o' at we'n
getten. But, eh, lasses, when aw coom to do it, aw hadn't th'
heart to ax for nought,&mdash;aw hadn't for sure.... Martha
an' me's walked aboon ten mile, if we'n walked a yard; an' we
geet weet through th' first thing; an' aw wur ill when we set
off, an' so wur Martha, too; aw know hoo wur; though hoo
says nought mich abeawt it. Well; we coom back through t'
teawn; an' we wur both on us fair stagged up. Aw never wur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
so done o'er i' my life, wi' one thing an' another. So we co'de
a-seem' Ann here; an' hoo made us a good baggin'&mdash;th' lass
did. See yo; aw wur fit to drop o'th flags afore aw geet that
saup o' warm tay into mo,&mdash;aw wur for sure! An' neaw hoo's
come'd a gate wi' us hitherto, an' hoo would make us have a
glass o' warm ale a-piece at yon heawse, lower deawn a bit; an'
aw dar' say it'll do mo good, aw getten sich a cowd; but, eh
dear, it's made mo as mazy as a tup; an' neaw hoo wants us to
have another, afore we starten off whoam. But it's no use; we
mun be gooin'. Aw'm noan used to it, an' aw connot ston'
it. Aw'm as wake as a kittlin' this minute."</p>

<p>Ann, who had befriended them in this manner, was the handsome
young woman, who seemed to be in work; and now the
poor woman who had been telling the story laid her hand upon
her friend's shoulder and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ann, thae's behaved very weel to us, o' roads; an' neaw,
lass, go thi ways whoam, an' dunnot fret abeawt us, mon. Aw
feel better neaw. We's be reet enough to-morn, lass. Mon,
there's awlus some way shap't That tay's done me a deeol o'
good.... Go thi ways whoam, Ann! Neaw do; or else
aw shan't be yezzy abeawt tho!"</p>

<p>But Ann, who was wiping her eyes with her apron, replied,
"Nawe, nawe; aw connot goo yet, Sarah!" ... And
then she began to cry, "Eh, lasses, aw dunnot like to see yo o'
this shap,&mdash;aw dunnot for sure! Besides, yo'n bin far enough
to-day. Come back wi' me! Aw connot find reawm for both
on yo; but thee come back wi' me, Sarah! Aw'll find thee a
good bed; an' thae'rt welcome to a share o' what there is&mdash;as
welcome as th' flowers i' May&mdash;thae knows that....
Thae'rt th' owdest o'th two; an' thae'rt noan fit to trawnce
up an' deawn o' this shap. Come back to eawr heawse;
an' Martha'll go forrud to Stopput (Stockport)&mdash;winnot tho,
Martha?... Thae knows, Martha," continued she, "thae
knows, thae munnot think nought at me axin' Sarah, an' noan
o' thee. Yo should both on yo go back if aw'd reawm,&mdash;but
aw haven't. Beside, thae'rt younger an' strunger than
hoo is."</p>

<p>"Eh, God bless tho, lass," replied Martha, "aw know o'
abeawt it. Aw'd rayther Sarah would stop, for hoo'll be ill.
Aw can go forrud by mysel', weel enough. It's noan so fur,
neaw."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>But here Sarah, the eldest of the three, laid her hand once
more upon the shoulder of her friend, and said, in an earnest
tone,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ann! It will not do, my lass! Goo, aw mun! Aw never
wur away fro whoam o' neet i' my life&mdash;never! Aw connot
do it, mon! Beside, thae knows, aw've laft yon lad; an' never
a wick soul wi' him! He'd fret hissel' to deeoth this neet,
mon, if aw didn't go whoam! Aw couldn't sleep a wink for
thinkin' abeawt him! Th' child would be fit to start eawt
o'th heawse i'th deeod time o'th neet, a-seechin' mo&mdash;aw know
he would!... Aw mun goo, mon! God bless tho, Ann;
aw'm obleeged to thee o'th same! But thae knows heaw it is."</p>

<p>Here the omnibus came up, and I rode back to Manchester.
The whole conversation took up very little more time than it
will take to read it; but I thought it well worth recording, as
characteristic of the people now suffering in Lancashire from no
fault of theirs. I know the people well. The greatest number
of them would starve themselves to that degree that they would
not be of much more physical use in this world, before they
would condescend to beg. But starving to death is hard work.
What will winter bring them when severe weather begins to
tell upon constitutions lowered in tone by a starvation diet&mdash;a
diet so different to what they have been used to when in work?</p>

<p>What will their eighteen-pence a-head weekly do for them in
that hard time? If something more than this is not done for
them, when more food, clothing, and fire are necessary to everybody,
calamities may arise which will cost England a hundred
times more than a sufficient relief&mdash;a relief worthy of those who
are suffering, and of the nation they belong to&mdash;would have cost.
In the meantime, the cold wings of winter already begin to
overshadow the land; and every day lost involves the lives, or
the future usefulness, of thousands of our best population.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi1"><span class="smcap">The</span> shores of the Isle of Man are remarkable for their
variety of indentation, especially at the southern end
of the island. There its most interesting scenery may
be found; bold, rugged headlands, beautiful bays, and
savage ravines, where the wild ocean churns and thunders in
majestic fury. But from the ruin-crested rock of Peel&mdash;so rich
in venerable memorials of the past&mdash;all round the shores of
"the fairy isle," there is not a more charming spot than Port
Erin, a little crag-defended bay at the southern end of the island,
about five miles west of Castletown. The outer shores of this
part of the island are wildly fantastic; the mountains cluster
grandest there, and the inland scenery is fertile and picturesque.
Bold and rugged as the entrance to Port Erin is from the sea, all
is quiet, and sweet, and sheltered at the head of the bay. The
contrast is striking, and pleasing to the mind. The little fishing
hamlet looks out contemplatively between those wild, flanking
rocks at the entrance, across the blue waters, to where the mountains
of Morne and Wicklow, in Ireland, show their faint outlines
in the west. The bay, from the point where the headlands&mdash;Brada
on the north side, and The Cassels on the south side of
the entrance&mdash;front each other, like sentinels placed to guard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
little nest beyond from all ravage of the sea, is about half a mile
across, and about a mile inland. From that point up to the
hamlet at the head of the water, Port Erin is a pleasant seclusion,
sweetly retired, even on the landward side, from bustle of
any kind, except such as the sea makes when a strong west wind
brings Neptune's white-maned horses into the little bay in full
career. Then, indeed, Port Erin wears an aspect of a nobler
and more spirit-stirring kind. But, even then, when the spray
is flying over the thatched roofs of the fishermen's cottages,
low down, near to the beach, the briny tumult is mere child's
play in a nursery nook, compared to the roaring majesty with
which the billows of the Atlantic wilderness rage among the
creeks, and chasms, and craggy headlands outside. At such a
time, the thunders of the sea in the Sound, which divides the
Calf Island from the main land, and amongst the storm-worn
headlands that overfrown the ocean immediately beyond the entrance
to Port Erin, come upon the ear of the listener, in his pleasant
shelter at the head of the bay, like the boom of distant war.
But when the wind is still, the clear tide fondles up the beach
at the foot of the village, as if it was glad to see that quiet nook
of Mona's Isle once more. Lipping the delicately-mottled strand
with liquid grace, it creeps lovingly up towards Port Erin's green
shore. Full of beautiful sounds, and hues, and motions, it comes,
with tender caresses, croodling its dreamy sea-song; and, as it
rises in gentle sweeps nearer and nearer to the cottages where
fishermen dwell, at the foot of the villaged slope, it flings fresh
shells upon the sand with every surge,&mdash;like a fond traveller returning
home laden with memorials of his journey, which show
that he has been thinking of those he loved, when far away.</p>

<p>But let us sit down upon some pleasant "coigne of vantage"
at the head of the bay, and look at the quaint little village
there. The hotel, called the "Falcon's Nest," looks right out
to sea from the head of the bay. It crowns a green slope of
grass-bound sand, which rises from behind an irregular line of
old thatched cottages upon the beach, not far from the head of
the tide. There is a green terrace in front of the hotel at the
head of the slope, where I have many a time sat and looked
about me with delight upon a summer's day. At one end of
the terrace there is a sun-dial; at the other a rusty old cannon,&mdash;a
relic of the Spanish Armada. It was found in the water
below Spanish Head, hard by Port Erin, where part of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
famous armament "came to grief." Great piles of fantastic sea-worn
rock, partly overgrown with greenery, stand, here and
there, upon the terrace; and ornamental seats are placed there,
for the use of visitors, when the weather is fine. The chimney
tops, and thatched roofs of fishermen's cottages, greened over
with wind-sown verdure, peep up from the foot of the slope,
which is crowned by the terrace. It is very pleasant to saunter
about, there, on a fine summer's day&mdash;or on any other day,&mdash;to
one who loves nature in all her moods. It is, perhaps,
better still to sit down, and look lovingly upon the scene.
The witchery of peace is on all around, when the wind is
still; the smoke from cottage chimneys rises idly into the pure
air&mdash;idle as Ludlam's dog, that leaned against a wall to bark.
It rises, here and there, in lazy blue rings&mdash;lounging curls of fat
blue smoke, that seem over-fed, and "done up" with pleasant
lassitude, as if they had just finished a good dinner; and would
rather have a nap before going out. The cottages of the village
are picturesquely strewn about, as if they had been dropped
through holes in a sack, by somebody who happened to be flying
over the place. But they chiefly cluster on the south side at the
head of the bay, about the bottom of the hill; not far from high
water. They, then, straggle up the southern hill-side&mdash;like
school children out for a holiday&mdash;one on this shelf of green
land; another in a nook of the hill; another on the nose of
a breezy bit of crag; others, in and out, dotting the sides of
the mountain road, which leads through the hamlet of Creag-y-N'eash,
in the direction of Spanish Head, and The Chasms,&mdash;the
most remarkable bit of coast scenery in all the island. About
the middle of the scattered village, a whitewashed chapel stands,
in a little patch of ground, enclosed by low walls. It stands
there, sweet and simple, by the side of the mountain road;
about one hundred feet above the head of the tide; and it is a
pleasing feature in the scene. The village is all under the eye
from the place where I am sitting, and the quiet play of out-door
life going on there is novel, and dreamy-looking. The
whole scene is picturesquely-varied. The wild mountain tops,
clustered in the direction of Fleshwick, as if in solemn council;
the dark, craggy headlands at the mouth of the bay, with the
blue sea heaving between; the smooth beach, where the clear
tide is singing and surging up; the quiet, wandering village; and
the green plain, rolling away between the hills, in picturesque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
undulations, landward. Port Erin is enchanted ground! There
are secluded nooks about it, that seem as if</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">Some congregation of the elves.</span><br />
<span class="i0">To sport by summer moons, had shaped them for themselves.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>The village is all under the eye. Down in the lowmost part,
where the cottages are nearest to the water, a blue-clad fisherman
leans against his door cheek, smoking, and gazing dreamily out
to sea. I wonder what the old man is thinking of. In front
of another cottage, a stout matron, with browned face and
brawny arms, is hanging up strips of conger eel, to dry in
the sun; whilst a little barefooted lass, about five years old,
staggers about the doorway, under the weight of a fat baby.
A little below the sun-dial, which stands at the end of the
green terrace, upon which I am sitting, a knot of Manx
fishermen are lounging upon the grass, around a pitcher of
the thin Manx ale, called "jough." Now they are very
merry, and they laugh and chatter in full chorus, with great
glee. Now their mirth subsides; and they draw around
an ancient mariner, who is telling a tale of an adventure he
had with the fairies, as he came over the mountain from
Fleshwick Bay, one night. It is wonderful how firmly these
islanders believe in fairies. Scratch deep enough into any
Manxman, and you will find fairies, dancing by moonlight,
amongst a world of other weird imaginations. But we will
let the old seaman go on with his story. The village is all
under the eye; and it is such a homely spot, that if one stays
a few days there, and is at all disposed to be communicative, one
begins to know everybody "by headmark," as the saying is&mdash;"Billy
this," and "Johnny that," and "Neddy Omragh;" and
the old wanderer from the neighbourhood of Pool Vash,
who invariably recites a little epitaph he wrote upon some
notable person in that quarter a few years ago; and who
invariably expects something for reciting it. One begins to
know the village folk "by headmark," as I have said before, and
they stop and salute you kindly, and chat about the weather, the
fishing, the crops, and such like; and there is something very
homely and pleasant in feeling one's self thus linked in a kindly
way to the rest of the human race wherever they go....
The village is all under the eye; and Port Erin is enchanted
ground. The voices of nature are not drowned there in a roar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
of human tumult. It is true that the unceasing murmur of
the tide fills all the air with its wild under-song; but its influence
is so fine and unobtrusive, that every sound of life in the
little village comes upon the untroubled sense distinctly framed
in the quietude which pervades that dreamy nook of Mona's
Isle, when the wind is low.... Let us look around, and
be silent; that one may hear what is going on. Behind me
is the cheerful hotel, the Falcon's Nest. The landlord stands
upon the door-step, giving directions about the stabling of certain
horses which have come up from Castletown. The horses are
taken round to the stables; and the landlord goes back into
his nest. Snatches of the old man's fairy tales come upon the
wind, when it blows, towards me. I hear broken bits of his
story, while his mates stand listening around him, in silent
wonder:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wass not thinking about nawthin', when I think I hear
somethin',&mdash;an' I look,&mdash;an' there was a little fellow close to
my leg. He was dressed in green an' red, with silver buckles
on his shooce. He wass about the sice of eight yearce. I make
a grab to get howlt of him,&mdash;so,&mdash;an' then,&mdash;I get a hand-full of
wind. I cannot see nawthin'. He is gone.... I wass
wan day makin' a hedge. It was up in Brada. There wass
nobody but myself. It was wonderful! Up in the air, I hear
them, shouting an' laughing. I know in a minute it is the fairies.
I hear them before, in the same place. They wass hunting. I
hear the cap'en o' the fairies. He give a shout,&mdash;an' all was
silence. Then the noice begin a-gain,&mdash;like people in a fair. I
hear them so well as I do see my hant. They wass hunting.
They have horses, an' dawgs. I hear them very well. The
whips wass cracking, an' horns wass blowing,&mdash;an' I hear the
little dawgs going wif! wif! wif! It wass wonderful! Then
the cap'en give a shout a-gain,&mdash;an' all wass silence. Then there
wass music. It wass so fine that I cannot hear it. But, I feel
there wass music playing up in the air.... I know it is
the fairies; and I say, 'I think it is time to be going home.' So,
I come a-way.... Another time, when I wass coming
down from Craig-y-N'eash, it come on dark, all at once,&mdash;so
dark as pitch. I look at my side. There wass a little fellow.
He wass just here (laying his hand upon his hip). He wass
about so big as my leg. I know it was a fairy. It was not a
body at all. He come to stale my boots." And so on. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
we let the old man finish his tale.... I can now hear
the footfall of a lonely traveller, as he stumps along the road
behind me, stick in hand. He is a stout, old, weather-beaten
Manxman, with gray hair; and he is dressed in coarse blue
woollen cloth. I can hear every footfall as he works his way
along the silent road towards the mountain side, in the direction
of Fleshwick Bay; and, now that I turn round to look
at him again, I see that the old man is wiping his forehead,
as he stumps along, stick in hand. I can hear women talking
at their doors below the slope, and upon the cottage-sprinkled
hill-side, in the direction of Creag-y-N'eash, I can hear the
prattle of little bare-legged lads, who are sailing their tiny,
chip-built ships, and clamorously discussing their relative qualities,
as they watch how they fare among the eddies and
rapids of the stream which runs down the green crease about
the middle of the village. I can hear the cackle of a large
family of very clean and very fat ducks, as they waddle
and paddle, and splash the water about, and open their wings,
and wag their dumpy tails with delight, upon the slushy
margin of a pool, where the same streamlet has been dammed
up, for their especial pleasure. I can hear the opening and
shutting, of cottage doors, in different parts of the village;
and I can hear something of the wild fringe of an old Manx
song, which a fisherman is crooning, as he saunters along
the strand towards his boat; which lies, high and dry, in
a sheltered nook, under the craggy cliff, at the south side
of the bay. I can hear the call of the Manx shepherd to his
dog, upon the dark mountain side, towards Brada Head. Each
sound is distinctly-framed in the pervading quietness of the
scene. At an open bow-window of the hotel behind me, two
elderly gentlemen sit talking together, and evidently enjoying
what little breeze there is from the sea. I have got it into
my head, somehow, that they are men of learning. One of
them is a stout, hearty-looking gentleman, who wears a black
velvet skullcap; and likes to dine in his own room,&mdash;"because
he has a good deal of writing to do." I wonder what he is
writing about. He is talking in a sonorous tone of voice, to a
dignified old friend of his, whose manners at table, I have
noticed, always evince the self-possession, the graceful, quiet
action, and kindliness which mark a cultivated gentleman. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
is tall and thin; and his noble aquiline nose sustains a pair
of gold spectacles. Perhaps the black velvet skullcap and
the gold spectacles have something to do with my notion that
they are learned men; but I believe I am right, nevertheless.
They are talking about the history of the island, and about
the geology of this part of it; especially about the mines at
Brada Head. I begin to think they have some interest in those
Brada mines; for they are talking of the projected breakwater,
and the possible future of Port Erin. I can hear them plain
enough. Not that I like "eaves-dropping;" but there they sit,
at the open window, and they see me; and they evidently don't
care a rap who hears them.... At another window, a
little farther off, two sunny-haired young ladies come and go,
like wandering posies, "freshening and refreshing all the scene"
with their sweet presence. They belong to some well-to-do
family of cultivated people, who have come to Port Erin to
bathe themselves in quietness, and in the fresh sea-breeze. I am
sure it is so, for a noble-looking man, considerably past the
noon of life, shows himself at the window, now and then, with
two more of these pretty trailers clinging to him. He is dressed
in black, and he wears a gold-framed double eye-glass; and his
fine countenance is lighted up with a quiet smile, as he paces to
and fro, listening to the prattle of the two lovely young women
who have hold of him&mdash;body and soul. It is very evident that
their prattle is music in his ears.... Now the mother
comes! I am quite sure that placid, handsome, matronly woman,
in the black silk dress, is the mother. She is a well-grown,
sweet-looking, sound-constitutioned dame; round as an apple,
and clear-skinned, and quietly-rosy; and kind-hearted, as anybody
may see, at the first glance, with half an eye. I durst
bet a thousand pounds she is a lady, in heart and thought.
She has seen enough of the world to enrich her experience; and
without hardening her heart. She is a good, womanly soul;
the kindliness of her nature breathes through every pore; and
speaks with angelic eloquence in every line and dimple of her
face. A few silver threads may be shining in her yet abundant
auburn hair, but they only serve to give a new tinge
of dignity to her appearance. She knows something of sorrow,
too, no doubt; for who can have lived so long in this world of
ours as she has lived, without being touched by the divine wand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
of that noble refiner of the noble heart? But the clouds have
long since gone; and her smiles, now, are not smiles</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That might as well be tears.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>She is, indeed, "one vast substantial smile," from head to foot,&mdash;a
sunbeam of feminine goodness, raising the atmosphere of happiness
around her, wherever she goes. Upon the whole, her
lines have evidently "fallen in pleasant places," and,&mdash;"So mote
it be," say I, "to the end of a long life yet to come." Now she
sits down by the open window; and a handsome, light-complexioned
lad, about twelve years old, is teasing her in an
affectionate way about something or another; whilst a beautiful,
sunny-haired girl, of sixteen or so, leans over the other shoulder,
and whispers, as she smooths the old lady's hair with tender
touches, "Mamma, dear, this!" and "Mamma, dear, that!"
And, oh, if there be an elysium on earth, that good old soul is in
it now! It is a beautiful glimpse of the smooth current of
human life.</p>

<p>Now I hear the clatter of horses' feet upon the road behind
me, and a car comes up to the door of the hotel, laden with a
company of young men, who are evidently "in great spirits."
They have, very likely, come across the island from Douglas,
making a call or two on the way. If one may measure their
enjoyment by the noise they make, they certainly ought to be
very happy. They alight and enter the hotel, whilst the car is
taken round to the stable yard; and, in a few minutes, I hear a
good deal more bell-ringing in the Falcon's Nest.</p>

<p>But who is this strange, gaunt fellow, that comes paddling
barefoot up the slope, from the low part of the village, muttering
to himself as he gazes vaguely around. It is poor Johnny Daly,
the affectionate, lunatic youth, who wanders over hill and
dale, in all weathers, harmless and happy in his unconscious helplessness.
He is a tall, strong, young man; but quite a child in
affectionate simplicity. Poor Johnny! He is only "mad nor-nor-west,"
after all. If he knows you, he either likes you well,
or he doesn't like you at all. If he takes to you, he comes quietly
up, and flutters about you like a pet dove with a broken wing;
croodling all sorts of inarticulate kindnesses in a touching and
not very demonstrative way; except that, now and then, as
he listens to your talk&mdash;no matter what you are talking of, nor
how badly&mdash;he suddenly clasps his hands and laughs boisterously;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
as if he had just discovered a great joke in the matter. If he
likes you, he will sit down upon the grass beside you, quietly
crooning some wild fragment of old Manx song, and looking
slyly up into your face from time to time; unless he chances
to spy the landlord of the hotel, or the owner of the one mansion
at Port Erin. If he sees either of these anywhere about,
it is a thousand to one that he will immediately leave you to your
own devices and desires, for the poor fellow knows who is kind
to him a great deal better than some of us do who think that we
have all our wits about us. Poor Johnny! He is fond of a
penny, like most of the world; and he needs it more than some
people do; although He "who tempers the wind to the shorn
lamb" has scattered a few kind hearts about the wanderer's way
that will not see him want for any needful thing. But I have
seen people that Johnny would not accept a penny from; and I
have many a time wondered at the curious principle of selection
which seemed to lurk in some corner of his disordered mind. I
remember a little excursion we made, one fine summer's day,
over the mountain on the south side of Port Erin, and among the
wild cliffs, near the Sound, which divides the Isle of Man from
The Calf. It was a company of six; and amongst them was
the landlord of the hotel&mdash;a kind-hearted and intelligent Englishman.
Johnny followed him, barefoot, all the rugged way, with
the affectionate instinct of a faithful dog. As we returned homeward,
by wandering, and sometimes dangerous tracks, along the
edge of the precipices, on the south side of the bay&mdash;where the
sea roared and dashed majestically among lonely creeks two or
three hundred feet below, and the cormorant and seagull wheeled
about the dark crags, and screamed with delight in the breeze,
half-way down between us and the water&mdash;our host disappeared
from the company for a little while, in search of something
among the rocks, whilst Johnny was picking his way carefully up
the prickly path ahead. Turning round, Johnny missed his
friend; and after he had looked for him again and again through
the company, and all over the scene, he sat himself down amongst
the heather, and gazing quietly at the blue sea, he murmured, in
a plaintive tone, "Now, he is gone! He is gone!" ...
In a minute or two, he kneeled down among the heather, and,
clasping his hands, like a child at its mother's knee, he muttered
a few broken sentences of the Lord's prayer, and then he sat
down and gazed silently at the sea again. And we could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
get him to rise, until his friend reappeared from behind a rock;
when he instantly rose and clapped his great brown hands, and
trotted after us, with painful steps, through the prickly bush,
stopping, now and then, to laugh aloud.... Poor Johnny!
As he comes paddling up the road from the village, he hears the
voice of the landlord, who is talking to the ostler at the house
end; and away he goes, in full trot, towards his friend, with
whom he is a great favourite.</p>

<p>And now, mild evening begins to draw her delicate curtains
over the drowsy world. All things below the sky are softening
into shade; and the pensive spell deepens the charm that pervades
this sleepy seaside nook of "Mona the lone, where the
silver mist gathers." The quiet life of the village is sinking to
repose. Barefooted lasses are fetching water from the ancient
well of Saint Catherine,&mdash;a beautiful spring, at the foot of the
sandy slope at the head of the bay; and an object of great veneration
to the inhabitants of the island. Lovers are stealing off to
quiet nooks outside the village; where they can whisper unseen.
Boats are coming in from the Sound, and from the blue sea
beyond. The fishermen haul them ashore in a sheltered shingly
nook, under the craggy southern cliffs; and then they saunter
homeward along the smooth beach, laden with fish and fishing
tackle; some of them singing drowsily, as they saunter along.
The murmurs of the sea become more distinct, filling all the air
with a slumbrous influence.... Now the fisher's wife
beets up her cottage fire, sweeps the hearth, and puts the kettle
on, to cheer her sea-beaten mate on his return from the wild
waters; and, here and there, fresh smoke is rising again from
cottage chimneys; bluer and more briskly than in the glowing
afternoon.... The old fisherman and his village companions
are mustering upon the grass at the end of the terrace again.
He has long since finished the story about his adventure with the
fairies among the mountains; and he has been carousing with his
comrades in the taproom of the Falcon's Nest. They have
brought another pitcher of "jough" out with them. And,
listen! They are beginning to sing, in chorus, the plaintive old
Manx song, called "Molly Charrane!" The strange melody
floats up, weird and sweet, blending beautifully with the murmurs
of the rising tide, and waking up remembrances of the wild
history and wilder legends of "Mona's fairy isle." The broad
glare of day is gone. The air is clearer; the green fields look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
greener; and the hues of the landscape are richer and more
distinct than before. The sun has "steeped his glowing axle"
in the sea. The gorgeous hues which linger over his track still
glow upon the wide waters; but "the line of light that plays
along the smooth wave toward the burning west," is slowly
retiring in the wake of the sunken sun. Let me look out, while
there is yet light, for the eye has glorious scope to roam in, from
the place where I am sitting.... At the head of
the bay&mdash;the scattered village; and the green land&mdash;green all
along the slopes of the hills, and all over the fertile undulant
plain between, stretching away inland, towards Castletown. It
is a pleasant nook of seaside life, at the head of the bay. But, as
I look seaward, the flanking headlands grow wilder as they recede,
ending in scenes of savage grandeur among the storm-worn crags
which front the open sea.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The cliffs and promontories there,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Front to front, and broad and bare,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Each beyond each, with giant feet</span><br />
<span class="i0">Advancing, as in haste to meet.</span><br />

<span class="i0">Blew his loud blast, and rushed in vain,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Tyrant of the drear domain.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>Those grim sentinels have seen strange scenes of storm, and
battle, and shipwreck, during their long watch over the entrance
to Port Erin. Oft has the ancient Dane steered his "nailed bark,"
laden with sea-robbers, into that little bay; and he has oft been
wrecked upon that craggy coast. Spanish Head overfrowned the
destruction of part of the great Armada. One of the guns of
that armament now lies upon the terrace in front of the hotel at
Port Erin; thickly encrusted with rust. Many a noble ship has
gone down in the Sound between the Island and the Calf of
Man.... As twilight deepens down, the breeze freshens,
and the blue waves begin to heave with life. Great white-winged
ships glide majestically by&mdash;some near, some far off; and some
almost lost to sight in the distance. Far away, in the west, the
outlines of the mountains of Morne and Wicklow are fading
away from view. It is a bewitching hour! It is a bewitching
scene! But now the Irish mountains have disappeared in the
shade; and the distant sea grows dim to the eye. The village
about me is sinking to rest; and candle-lights begin to glimmer
through cottage windows. The old fisherman and his
companions have gone back into the taproom of the Falcon's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
Nest. The wind is rising still; and the air grows cold. I,
too, will retire until the world has donned its night-dress; and
so good-by to this fairy scene for a while! The moon rises
at ten! Perhaps I may come forth to look around me once
more, when the world lies sleeping beneath her quiet smile.
If not, then farewell to thee, Port Erin!</p>

<p class="drop-capi1"><span class="smcap">Life</span> in Manchester may seem monotonous to a Parisian
or to a Londoner, but it has strong peculiarities; and
among its varied phases there are some employments
little known to the rest of the world. Many a
stranger, whilst wandering through the back streets of the
city, has been puzzled at sight of little signboards, here and
there, over the doors of dingy cottages, or at the head of a
flight of steps, leading to some dark cellar-dwelling, containing
the words, "<span class="smcap">Knocking-Up Done Here</span>." To the uninitiated
this seems a startling, and unnecessary announcement, in such
a world as ours; and all the more so, perhaps, on account
of the gloom and squalid obscurity of the quarters where such
announcements are generally found. Horrible speculations have
haunted many an alien mind whilst contemplating these rude
signboards, until they have discovered that the business of
the Knocker-Up is simply that of awakening people who
have to go to work early in a morning; and the number
of these is very great in a city like ours, where manufacturing
employments mingle so largely with commercial life.
Another reason why this curious employment is so common in
Manchester may be that there are so many things there to lure a
working man into late hours of enjoyment,&mdash;so many wild
excitements that help to "knock him up," after his ordinary
work is over, and when his time is his own, so many temptations
to "lengthen his days by stealing a few hours from the night,"
that the services of the morning "Knocker-Up" are essential.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
For the factory-bell, like death, is inexorable in its call; and
when, in the stillness of the morning, the long wand of the
awakener comes tapping at the workman's window, he knows
that he must rise and go; no matter how ill-prepared,&mdash;no
matter how mis-spent his night may have been. He must
go; or he knows full well the unpleasant consequence. If
he likes he may try to ease his mind by crooning the words
of that quaint lyric, "Up in a morning, na for me;" but,
in the meantime, he must get up and go. He may sing it
as he goes, if he likes; but whether he does so or not, he must
walk his chalks, or else it will be worse for him. Apart from
factory-workers, there are other kinds of workmen who need
awakening in a morning; especially those connected with the
building trades, whose hours of rising are sometimes uncertain,
because they may be employed upon a job here to-day, and then
upon one two or three miles off, to-morrow. Factory workers,
too, are compelled, in many cases, to reside at considerable distances
from the mills at which they are employed. These two
classes of working people, however, are the principal customers
of the "Knocker-Up."</p>

<p>Whoever has seen Manchester in the solitary loveliness of a
summer morning's dawn, when the outlines of the buildings stand
clear against the cloudless sky, has seen the place in an aspect of
great beauty. In that hour of mystic calm, when the houses are
all bathing in the smokeless air,&mdash;when the very pavement seems
steeped in forgetfulness, and an unearthly spell of peaceful rapture
lies upon the late disturbed streets,&mdash;that last hour of nature's
nightly reign, when the sleeping city wears the beauty of a new
morning, and "all that mighty heart is lying still;"&mdash;that
stillest, loveliest hour of all the round of night and day,&mdash;just
before the tide of active life begins to turn back from its lowmost
ebb, or, like the herald drops of a coming shower, begins
to patter, here and there, upon the sleepy streets once more;
whoever has seen Manchester at such a time, has seen it clothed
in a beauty such as noontide never knew. It is, indeed, a sight
to make the heart "run o'er with silent worship." It is pleasant,
even at such a time, to open the window to the morning
breeze, and to lie awake, listening to the first driblets of sound
that stir the heavenly stillness of the infant day:&mdash;the responsive
crowing of far-distant cocks; the chirp of sparrows about
the eaves and neighbouring house-tops; the barking of dogs; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
stroke of some far-off church clock, booming with strange distinctness
through the listening air; a solitary cart, jolting slowly
along, astonished at the noise it is making. The drowsy
street&mdash;aroused from its slumbers by those rumbling wheels&mdash;yawns
and scratches its head, and asks the next street what
o'clock it is.... Then come the measured footsteps
of the slow-pacing policeman, longing for six o'clock; solitary
voices conversing in the wide world of morning stillness; the
distant tingle of a factory bell; the dull boom of escaping steam,
let off to awake neighbouring workpeople; the whistle of the
early train; and then,&mdash;the hurried foot, and "tap, tap, tap!"
of the Knocker-Up. Soon after this, shutters begin to rattle,
here and there; and the streets gradually become alive again.</p>

<p>He who has wandered about the city, with observant eye,
at dawn of morning, may have seen men&mdash;and sometimes a
woman&mdash;hurrying along the street, hot-foot, and with "eyes
right," holding aloft long taper wands, like fishing-rods. These
are Knockers-Up, going their hasty rounds, from house to house,
to rouse the workman to his labour. They are generally old
men, who are still active on foot; or poor widows, who retain
sufficient vigour to enable them to stand the work; for it is an
employment that demands not only severe punctuality, but great
activity: there is so much ground to cover in so little time. It
is like a "sprint-race"&mdash;severe whilst it lasts, but soon over.
And the aim of the Knocker-Up is to get as many customers
as possible within as small a circle as possible,&mdash;which greatly
lessens the labour. A man who has to waken a hundred people,
at different houses, between five and six o'clock, needs to have
them "well under hand," as coachmen say. With this view,
Knockers-Up sometimes exchange customers with one another,
so as to bring their individual work as close together as possible.
The rate of pay is from twopence to threepence per week for
each person awakened; and the employment is sometimes combined
with the keeping of a coffee-stall at some street end, where
night stragglers, and early workmen, can get their breakfast of
coffee and bread-and-butter, at the rate of a halfpenny per
cup, and a halfpenny per slice for bread-and-butter. Sometimes,
also, the Knocker-Up keeps a little shop in some back
street, where herbs, and nettle beer, and green grocery, or
fish, or children's spices are sold; and, after this fashion, many
poor, faded folk,&mdash;too proud for pauperism,&mdash;eke out a thin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
unostentatious living, out of the world's eye. So much for the
occupation of the Knocker-Up. And now for a little incident
which led to all this preamble.</p>

<p>The other day, as I sat poring over my papers, a startling
knock came to the street door. It was one, solid, vigorous
bang,&mdash;with no nonsense about it. It was heavy, sharp, straightforward,
and clean-cut at the edges,&mdash;like a new flat-iron. There
was no lady-like delicacy about it,&mdash;there was no tremulous
timidity, no flabbiness, nor shakiness, nor billiousness, nor any
kind of indication of ill-condition about that rap. It was
sound&mdash;wind, limb, and all over. It was short and decisive,&mdash;in
the imperative mood, present tense, and first person,&mdash;very
singular; and there was no mistake about its gender&mdash;it was,
indeed, massively masculine&mdash;and it came with a tone of swift
authority&mdash;like a military command. It reminded me of "Scarborough
warning,"&mdash;a word and a blow&mdash;and the blow first.
That rap could stand on its own feet in the world,&mdash;and it
knew it. It came boldly, alone, "withouten any companie,"&mdash;not
fluttering, lame and feeble, with feeble supporters about
it,&mdash;like a man on ricketty stilts, that can only keep his feet by
touching carefully all round. It shot into the house like a
cannon-ball, cutting a loud tunnel of strange din through the all-pervading
silence within. The sleepy air leaped, at once, into
wakefulness,&mdash;and it smote its forehead with sudden amazement,
and gazed around to see what was the matter. I couldn't tell
whatever to make of the thing. My first thought was that it
must be the man who examines the gas meters, and that he was
behind with his work, and in a bad temper about something.
And then I began to think of my debts: it might be an indignant
creditor, or some ruthless bully of a dun&mdash;which is a good
deal worse&mdash;and I began to be unhappy. I sighed, from the
bottom of my heart, and looked round the room in search of comfort.
Alas! there was nothing there to cheer my sinking spirits.
The drowsy furniture had started from its long-continued trance;
and the four somnolent walls were staring at one another with
wild eyes, and whispering, "What's that?" The clock was
muttering in fearful undertones to the frightened drawers; and
the astonished ceiling, as it gazed down at the trembling carpet,
whispered to its lowly friend, "Look out!" as if it thought the
whole house was coming down. I looked at my watch&mdash;for, indeed,
I hardly knew where to look&mdash;and I began to apprehend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
that the fatal hour had come, at last, when we should have
to part,&mdash;perhaps for ever. I looked at my poor old watch....
It had stopped.... The fact is, the little thing
was stunned. The numerals had tears of terror in their eyes;
and it held out its tiny hands for protection,&mdash;like a frightened
child, flying to its mother from a strange tumult. I felt sorry
for the little thing; and I rubbed the case with my coat
sleeve, and then wound it gently up, by way of encouragement;
and&mdash;the grateful, willing creature&mdash;it only missed about half
a dozen beats or so, and then began ticking again, in a
subdued way, as if it was afraid of being overheard by the
tremendous visitor who had so furiously disturbed "the even
tenor of its way." The whole house was fairly aroused; tables,
chairs, pictures,&mdash;all were in a state of extraordinary wonderment.
The cat was the only thing that kept its senses. It rose
from the hearth, and yawned, and stretched itself; and then it
came and rubbed its glossy fur soothingly against my leg, and
whispered, "All serene! Don't faint!" In the meantime, I
could imagine that rap,&mdash;as soon as it had delivered the summons,&mdash;listening
joyfully outside, and saying to itself; with a
chuckle, "I've wakened that lot up, for once!" ... At
last I mustered courage, and, shaking myself together, I went to
the door.</p>

<p>A little, wiry old man stood at the door. His clothing was
whole, but rough, and rather dirty. An old cloth cap was on
his grey head; and he was in a state of curious disorder from head
to toe. He had no braces on; and he was holding his trousers
up with one hand. I couldn't tell what to make of him. He
was a queer-looking mortal; and he had evidently "been dining,"
as the upper ten thousand say when any of their own set get
drunk. At the first glance, I thought he was begging; but I
soon changed my mind about that, for the hardy little fellow
stood bolt upright, and there was not the shadow of anything
like cringing or whining about him. The little fellow puzzled
me. He looked foggy and dirty; but he had an unmistakable
air of work and rugged independence. Steadying himself with
one hand against the door-cheek, he muttered something that I
couldn't make out.</p>

<p>"Well; what is it?" said I.</p>

<p>Again he muttered something that sounded like "Knocked
Up;" to which I mildly replied that he certainly looked as if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
was so; and then I inquired what I could do for him; but, to
my astonishment, this seemed to vex him. At last I found that
he was a Knocker-Up, and that he had called for his week's
"brass." I saw at once that the old man was astray; and the
moment I told him where he was, his eyes seemed to fill with a
new light, and he exclaimed, "By th' mon, aw'm i'th wrang
street!" And then, holding his trousers up, still, with one
hand, away he ran, and was no more seen by me.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi1"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I am a nuisance, and therefore I suppose it is
right, in the abstract, that I should be put down.
Unfortunately, however, many of the persons and
things by which I am surrounded are the same to me,
and I feel, by fits, vastly inclined to extinguish them, although I
know full well, in my sane moments, that they are generally
useful. And so it is, right to the end of the piece; everything
and everybody is, by turns, a nuisance to everybody and everything
else; and if there were no restraint upon the public vanity,
and private pique, and officious frivolities which affect these
conflicting elements, the whole body politic, being composed of
nuisances, would be destroyed, like the Irish cats in the story.
In fact, sir, there is nobody in the world that is not a nuisance
to somebody; though that is hardly a sufficient reason why they
should be allowed to worry one another. But in these days, the
art and mystery of grumbling&mdash;that native prerogative which
has grown up so luxuriantly in the soil of our English freedom,
that the grumblers now constitute an eminently valuable power in
the state&mdash;the art and mystery of grumbling (it really is artful
and mysterious sometimes) is now growing into a kind of social
scurvy, more annoying than serviceable, and sometimes exceeding
in offensiveness the nuisances which it scratches into notice.
The contagion is getting to such a pitch just now, that it is time
for the nuisances to speak for themselves&mdash;for even a nuisance
has a right side&mdash;and although I myself am one, I shall be grateful
if you will allow me&mdash;just this once&mdash;to say a few words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
respecting the treatment to which many of my humbler brethren
are subjected by the magnates of the tribe. I feel the more
hopeful that you will grant this, since I know that I am not the
only nuisance to which you have, with admirable forbearance,
opened the columns of your excellent journal.</p>

<p>Happily, the expression of opinion is so free in this country,
that&mdash;although some offensive persons deny that a nuisance has
the slightest right to appeal to <i>any</i> of the senses&mdash;I will venture
to assert, backed by all known law and custom, that even a
nuisance has a right to be <i>heard</i>&mdash;at least, <i>in its own defence</i>;
thanks to that instinctive leaning to fair play which, while it
deprecates anything that is foul, yet acknowledges that even
foulness itself may, sometimes, have a fair side. My dear sir,
we nuisances have endured so much, as we may say, from those
of our own household, that the patience of the most Christian
nuisance in the world must give way under such an incessant
fire of impertinent insult. Ah me! there seems to be so little
fellow-feeling amongst nuisances now-a-days, that it may be worth
while to remind them all of the poet's little sermon beginning,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O wad some power the giftie gie us,</span><br />
<span class="i0">To see oursels as ithers see us.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>Nuisance-hunters are always, of course, a nuisance to the nuisances;
but the hunters are so often worse, upon the whole,
than the hunted, that it would be a general benefit to hold up
the mirror to these inconsiderate grumblers a little now and
then. To whom, then, in this difficulty, can we appeal, but to
you, oh Mr. Editor? who are yourself a very rock of offence to
some misguided persons; who are, doubtless, a stumbling-block
to you.</p>

<p>How the theme widens as one pursues it There is something
comical about the pathology of public grumbling. Is it
not a fact well known to you, my dear sir, that there exists an
inexhaustible class of persons who, having little or no capacity
for distinguishing themselves publicly in any nobler fashion, and
fearing, above all things, that obscurity which is their natural
destiny, are constantly racking their wits for something to write
to the papers about. How many such have you, yourself, sir,
out of the sheer kindliness of your nature&mdash;not unmixed with a
certain sense of the humour of the thing&mdash;lent a little fame to,
by deigning, occasionally, to embalm their crude frivolities in
your own clear "nonpareil". To such persons, anything will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
serve for a subject, if they can only twist it into the shape of a
complaint: strong smells, and strange smells, which are not
strong; suspicious loiterers in lonely places; gaslight when the
moon shines, and want of gas when a cloud happens to be passing
over the moon; flying chips from masons' chisels, which have
been stopt in their flight by the rubicund tip of some respectable
gentleman's nose; bits of orange peel on the flags; public clocks
that are too fast, or too slow, or are stopt altogether, or have
their fingers bent, or the faces of which are partly hidden by the
encroaching insignia of ambitious pawnbrokers, or are in places
where they are not needed, or <i>are not</i> in places where they <i>are</i>
needed; pavements which are too slippery for horses, and too
rough for ladies; music to people who have no ear for it, and
noises to people who have a delicate ear for music, and either to
people who like neither; mutually-discordant neighbours; church
bells that are not rung, and church bells that are rung too much,
and church bells that are not melodious when they are rung;
holes in the street, and places where holes are likely to be, sometime;
too much water, and too little water; cockle shells;
broken pots; the smell of dinners floating up from hotel kitchens;
and the inarticulate wails of chip-sellers and fish women; want
of loyalty to the crown; want of loyalty to the people; the insolence
of cabmen, and railway buffers; sneezing during service-time;
fast-days, proposed by people who are ill with feasting,
and feast-days, proposed by people who are ill with fasting;
general holidays, proposed by those who are paid for their holidays,
and objected to by those who are not paid for them; and
a thousand other things, more insignificant even than these;
sometimes ferreted out by ingenious old fogies, of an irritable
disposition, who go tooting about the streets, "finding things
out;" or by young "green" persons, driven to their wits' end by
a kind of literary measles. Heaven knows, I do not wish to
"freeze the genial current" of such poor souls as these latter,
but then, Mr. Editor, we must draw the line somewhere. With
respect to the former, have I not seen such a self-elected old
nuisance inspector, going slowly along the street, groping with
his sharp proboscis for something in the morning air to grumble
about in graceful prose, and meeting with a smell which he did
not quite understand&mdash;a smell which perhaps had travelled "ever
so far" before it met him, and was on its way into the country,
there to die peaceably upon the general air, if he had only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
allowed it to go&mdash;he straightway halts, he sniffs at it carefully&mdash;he
affiliates it upon something convenient&mdash;he looks grave&mdash;he
whips out a pocket-book, and makes a note, to be wrought into
an epistolary complaint at leisure, in the fervent hope of its appearing
among Saturday's correspondence. Have I not known
persons, whose jangled senses, refusing the Lethæn balm of sleep,
have lain awake o' nights, listening indignantly to the weird
howls of libidinous cats, prowling about the back yards, and the
rigging of the house, and making the sleepless midnight doubly
hideous with their "shrill ill will,"&mdash;who have started up irritably
from their pillow at last, and, striking a match, have exclaimed,
"Drat that cat! Why don't the police look after these things?
I will write to the papers." In fact, sir, the extravaganzas of
public complaint are endless in variety, and, not unfrequently,
very unreasonable.</p>

<p>I know a manufactory of a certain kind, which was established
many years ago, in a spot as remote as was convenient,
and wholly uninhabited for some distance around, in the hope
of being free from the charge of anything in the shape of
nuisance; but, as years rolled on, population gathered about it,
and grumbling began, which, by irregular fits, has been carried
on ever since; and whenever the complaint could manage to get
a "respectable start," it was sure to be well followed up; without
thought, as such cries often are. Even in the papers of the last
few days, letter after letter has appeared, complaining of the effluvia
arising from certain alum works in Salford. Some of these letters
are written by gentlemen whose delicate nasal discrimination
amounts to a marvel, if not to a miracle, when we remember
the distance they live from the spot complained of. How on
earth any smell, such as the one alluded to by these gentlemen,
can manage to travel two mortal miles, in a high wind, working
its passage through a hundred other smokes and smells as it
goes, and still preserve its own individuality, surpasses me to
know. But so it is. Up to Kersall Moor, and other green
nooks of nestling, miles off, where the human nose is critical,
this compact nuisance cleaves its way through the murky air,
keeping wonderfully free from communion with the elements it
passes through, and strikes the senses at that distance as distinctly
as if it were a flat-iron. It seems to hold itself in till it has
found out noses which can appreciate it, and then it "comes out
strong," evidently making an effort to reveal all the pent-up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
pungency of its nature, in the hope of gaining a little respectable
distinction. It is an aristocratic smell, too. It likes good society,
and will associate with none but gentlemanly noses. It has to
travel for it, though; for, like the prophets, it is not honoured
with any remarkable notice in its own neighbourhood. Now,
noses such as these are "something like," as the saying is; and,
but for such noses, how on earth should we, who live amongst
it, be able to discriminate one smell from another in the complication
of odours which crowd the air of this busy district,&mdash;except
in such cases as the town's manure yard, which overpowers
everything else for a mile around with its intolerable
native strength,&mdash;is strong enough, indeed, in the height of
summer, "for a man to hang his hat upon," as the Irish say.
That, now, is a smell really worth notice, if it were only
possible to get an alderman or two to speak about it.</p>

<p>When it happens to be fashionable to raise an outcry against
any particular manufacturer, as in the case of these unfortunate
alum works, what is that manufacturer to do? Is he to take up
his works and walk, from one locality to another, every time an
inconsiderate complaint happens to be made against him? Is he
to become a kind of nomadic outcast? Is he to betake himself
to utter solitude, and go from one "desert where no men abide"
to another "desert where no men abide"&mdash;a manufacturing voice,
crying for orders in the wilderness, and finding none&mdash;until his
occupation becomes unprofitable to himself or anybody else?</p>

<p>And then, the tone in which complaint after complaint has
been uttered, in the case of these works in Salford, is rather
curious. "<i>The</i> Nuisance in Pendleton!" That is the title
of more than one letter on the subject. "<i>The</i> Nuisance in
Pendleton!" Good heavens! Who art thou, O man, that
writeth thus? Oh, happy Pendleton, with <i>one</i> nuisance! Go
thy ways, and break forth into singing, thou pleasant, and, in
some places, rather green suburb,&mdash;break forth into singing, even
from Windsor Bridge right away up Eccles Old Road, and in
every other direction, to the utmost extent of thy remarkable
borders,&mdash;break forth into singing! Thou with the long pole
standing near the church, and the cock upon the top of it,&mdash;rejoice,
and give thanks, for thy extraordinary exemption from
the common troubles of this manufacturing locality! And well
might Pendleton sing, if this were true; but who does not know
how many things which are really useful and necessary, are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
always pleasant to those who have no immediate interest in
them? Who does not know that if everything which is a nuisance
to somebody or another, at one time or another, were removed
from society, there would be hardly anything useful left
in society at all,&mdash;and if all the nuisances in society were to cry
out in this way, at once, against each other, who knows where
it would end? They would cleave the general ear with horrid
grumbling. Really, gentlemen who get their living by the
necessary infliction of unpleasant noises, and smokes, and steams,
and smells, upon people who are forced to live among them
because they live, in a certain sense, by them, should be a little
more considerate. They should, at least, remember that, although
they can leave the town, and live in palatial houses, situated in
pleasant spots, "far removed from noise and smoke," where the
air is so beautifully different that it makes them a little particular,
they leave their own share of the nuisances of the town
behind them, to be patiently endured by an immense multitude
of people who cannot escape from them,&mdash;if they wish to
live,&mdash;and who, although they are just the people who suffer
most from them, are, also, just the people who would be the
least heeded if they were to cry out against them.</p>

annals of Blackley bear ample testimony to the superstition of its inhabitants. It
has had its nine days' wonder at every period of its history. Hollingworth, writing
of that age of portents and prodigies which succeeded the Reformation, says:&mdash;'In
Blackley, neere Manchester, in one John Pendleton's ground, as one was reaping,
the corne being cut seemed to bleede; drops fell out of it like to bloud; multitudes
of people went to see it: and the straws thereof, though of a kindly colour without,
were within reddish, and as it were bloudy!' Boggart-hole Clough, too, was another
favourite haunt of ghostly visitants, the legend of which has been perpetuated by
Mr. Roby in his "Traditions of Lancashire," vol. 2, pp. 295, 301. Nor has it ceased
in our day: in 1852 one of its inhabitants imperilled the safety of his family and
neighbours, by undermining the walls of his cottage, in his efforts to discover the
hidden cause of some mysterious noise that had disturbed him."</p></div></div>
